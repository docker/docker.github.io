The Docker Modernize Traditional Applications (MTA) Program helps enterprises
make their existing applications more secure, efficient, and readily
portable to a hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Here, we identify the biggest problems with traditional applications, show how
containerizing apps and infrastructure solves these problems, and describe in
general terms the migration steps from traditional to containerized applications
running on [Docker Enterprise
Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition){: target="_blank"
class="_"}.

Check out the [blog post introducing the Docker MTA program
here](https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/modernizing-traditional-apps-with-docker/){:

## The problem with traditional apps

IT organizations often spend 80% of their budget maintaining existing
applications and only 20% on new innovation.

Traditional apps can be any age and use any technology stack, with some common traits which makes them expensive and time-consuming to maintain.

### Automated testing and deployment

- no automated test suites
- no automated deployment proceses

Releasing updates requires a lot of manual work such as copying files, updating
configurations and running installers.

Manual testing and test scripts to validate new features and test for
regressions.

Large enterprise apps might need an entire weekend or more to deploy, which is
expensive and discourages updates.

Difficult to administer between deployments often needing custom logging and management with multiple tools, and manual processes. Frameworks, dependencies, and load balancing are often complex, and VMs are often underutilized, 

Enterprises have increasingly disparate infrastructure landscapes with x86
servers, mainframe, and multiple private and public clouds to manage. This
fragmentation increases the pressure on IT budgets, making it even harder to
focus on innovation.

### VIDEO WITH ADDED CONTEXT FROM OTHER DOCS - WIP

.NET video is [here](https://youtu.be/gaJ9PzihAYw){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

Below is the general idea or pattern, extrapolated from the video with added
context from other docs. Other content on this page is also extrapolated from the video.

Video starting point is a .NET 3.5 app running on Windows server 2003

Problems:

- difficult to deploy
- complex to maintain
- expensive to change

Ways to migrate an app to Docker

- manually
- use an automated tool like Image2Docker

Docker containerized apps are portable, efficient, and secure. Once the app is migrated to Docker, you get:

- a portable unit that can run in the cloud or data center the same way

- an efficient and lightweight software stack, running on less infrastructure than VMs

- ability to add comprehensive security into your own apps via the Docker platform

Explains how you can use Docker to bring old apps into the modern world without
changing code. With Docker, you can:

- move apps to the cloud or the data center
- move apps onto new infrastructure
- or consolidate apps on existing infrastructure


Docker provides certified Docker EE containers and application stacks for
commonly used enterprise workloads. Examples of available software stacks are:

- Microsoft .NET web apps
- Oracle
- IBM
- SAP

It can be any infrastructure. MTA Runbooks will be available for these architectures and more:

- HPE
- ALIBABA
- Azure \ AzureStack
- IBM
- Oracle
- Cisco
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- AWS

## How Docker solves the problem

Legacy apps don't have to define your capabilities. You can still move forward
on innovation goals, and bring modern behavior to your current apps without
changing a single line of code.

![MTA time and cost savings](images/MTA.png)

By containerizing the application without modifying source code,  legacy apps
can be modernized to hybrid cloud portability, increased security and cost
efficiency.

- Efficient (optimize CapEx and OpEx costs, reduce the size of infrastructure by 77%)
- Portable (infrastructure for portability and independent apps, deployment frequency increases 13x or more)
- Secure (reduce risk and enforce new controls, MTTR for patching is 99% faster)

Modernizing traditional apps can be approached in logical steps to gain
efficiencies and benefits at ever step.

![MTA workflow](images/MTA-process.png)

The migration process consists of these high-level steps:

1.  Package the application into a container using Docker EE, and
validate the it.

2.  Decide where to deploy the application (for example, migrate to cloud or server refresh).

3.  Deploy and confirm.

4.  Integrate the container into automated builds, integration testing, and
auto-deployment to further optimize and save time.

5.  Consider splicing and reconfiguring the Dockerized app code into
microservices, or add new services to the existing container.

The subtopics go into more detail on this process.

### Choose an infrastructure

See MTA Runbooks and per stack reference architectures at https://docker.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTA/pages/139010984/MTA+Infrastructure+Stacks

### Get Docker

Docker install platforms and overview is [here](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

### Set up your Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) with cloud templates

1.  Docker EE 30-day trial is [here](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-trial?tab=description).

2.  Launch Docker EE

    - [Launch Docker EE on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XCFDF9K)

    - [Launch Docker EE on Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/docker.dockerdatacenter?tab=Overview)

    - Install [Docker for Mac](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XCFDF9K) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

### Port the application

1.  Select a.NET IIS for Windows Server or LAMP stack, Java or Tomcat for Linux. (Itâ€™s best to start with a single server app.)

2.  Run the appropriate Image2Docker tool for Windows Server or Linux to convert the existing app into a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

    - Download [Image2Docker for Windows Server](https://github.com/docker/communitytools-image2docker-win)

    - Download [Image2Docker for Linux Server](https://github.com/docker/communitytools-image2docker-linux)

3.  Follow the instructions to build the image and run locally. Push the image to your Docker Trusted Registry.

4.  Build the image locally and push to your Docker Trusted Registry with Security Scanning activated.

### Run your app as a containerized service

Launch the app with either a [`docker run`](/engine/reference/commandline/run.md), [`docker-compose up`](/compose/reference/up.md), or [`docker stack deploy`](/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy.md) command.
