#  Example Applications

Upcoming releases will include example applications especially tailored for Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows.

Examples will highlight develop, build, and run workfows in several languages, including Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Java.

For now, if you want get started experimenting with the Beta apps and Docker Compose (which is installed automatically with Docker Desktop Editions), have a look at these example applications in the Compose documentation. You should be able to run these with Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows.
