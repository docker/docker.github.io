  * **Known issues**
    - Migration from Toolbox can fail sometimes.
      In case this happens, the application needs to be restarted.
    - Docker needs to open ports on the firewall. Sometimes, the user will see
      a firewall alert dialog. The user should allow the ports to be opened.
    - The application was upgraded to 64 bits. The installation path changed to
      `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`. Powershell/Cmd windows already opened
      before the update might have to be closed to catch the new `PATH`.
      In some cases, the user should even log off and on again.

  * **Bug Fixes**
    - Kill VMs that cannot be shutdown properly
    - Improve the diagnostic information sent with bugsnag reports
