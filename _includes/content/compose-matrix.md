There are several versions of the Compose file format â€“ 1, 2, 2.1 and 3. For
details on versions and how to upgrade, see
[Versioning](compose-versioning.md#versioning) and
[Upgrading](compose-versioning.md#upgrading).

This table shows which Compose file versions support specific Docker releases.

| **Compose file format** | **Docker Engine release** |
|  -------------------    |    ------------------     |
|      3.3                |       17.06.0+            |
|      3.0 - 3.2          |       1.13.0+             |
|      2.1                |       1.12.0+             |
|      2.0                |       1.10.0+             |
|      1.0                |       1.9.1.+             |

In addition to Compose file format versions shown in the table, the Compose
product itself is on a release schedule, as shown in [Compose
releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/), but file format versions
do not necessairly increment with each release. For example, Compose file format
3.0 was introduced in [Compose release
1.10.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.10.0), and versioned
gradually in subsequent releases.

However, if you are using an older version of Docker and want to determine which
Compose release is compatible, please refer to the [Compose release
notes](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/). Each set of release notes
gives finer-tuned detail on which versions of Docker Engine are supported, along
with compatible Compose file format versions. (See also, the discussion in
[issue #3404](Compatibility matrix between docker-compose and docker versions)
on GitHub.)
