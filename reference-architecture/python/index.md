> Thanks for your interest in learning how to containerize a Python application. We are actively writing the reference architecture guide for containerizing Python applications. Watch this space!

Meanwhile, here's an outline of the tasks we are planning to cover. Using the Python reference architecture guide, you'll learn how to:

* Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Python image
* Build an image and run the newly built image as a container
* Set up volumes and networking.
* Orchestrate containers using Compose
* Use containers for development
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions.
