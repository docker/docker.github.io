> Thanks for your interest in learning how to containerize a Java application. We are actively writing the reference architecture docs for containerizing Java applications. Watch this space!

Meanwhile, here's an outline of the tasks we are planning to cover. Here's an outline of what we'd like to cover. Using the Java reference architecture guide, you'll learn how to:

* Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Java image
* Build an image and run the newly built image as a container
* Set up a local development environment to connect a database to the container, and use Docker Compose to run the application.
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions.
