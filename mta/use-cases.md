## MetLife

MetLife wanted to modernize one of their legacy Java apps running in their data
center so that they could reduce costs and establish a common governance modely
for all of their applications. Their priorities going in were time to commit reduction, common governance model, security, self-service platform, and standard deployment model.

They achieved a 99% faster timespan from code to production, a 50% decrease in infrastructure utilzation, an 84x decrease in meantime to resolution for security patches, and a 99% increase in average time to scale.
