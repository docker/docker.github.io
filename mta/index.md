The Docker Modernize Traditional Applications (MTA) Program helps enterprises
make their existing legacy apps more secure, more efficient, and readily
portable to a hybrid cloud infrastructure.

This page gives an overview of the problem and the Docker solution.

Also, check out the [blog post introducing the Docker MTA program
here](https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/modernizing-traditional-apps-with-docker/){:

## Legacy apps limit potential

IT organizations continue to spend 80% of their budget on simply maintaining
their existing applications while only spending 20% on new innovation. At the
same time, enterprise organizations have increasingly disparate infrastructure
landscapes with x86 servers, mainframe, and multiple private and public clouds
to manage. This fragmentation increases the pressure on your IT budget, making
it even harder to focus on innovation.

## Modernize traditional apps with Docker EE

Legacy apps don't have to define your capabilities. You can still achieve
innovation goals, and bring modern behavior to your current apps without
changing a single line of code.

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) enables IT Ops to modernize traditional
applications with the leading container platform without changing a single line
of code.

By simply containerizing the application without modifying the source
code, legacy applications begin the journey to modernization with hybrid cloud
portability, increased security and cost efficiency.

## How Docker solves the problem

Docker EE gives legacy apps modern capabilities, making them efficient, portable, and secure.

- Efficient (optimize CapEx and OpEx costs, reduce the size of infrastructure by 77%)
- Portable (infrastructure for portability and independent apps, deployment frequency increases 13x or more)
- Secure (reduce risk and enforce new controls, MTTR for patching is 99% faster)
