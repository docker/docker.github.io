Testing is an essential part of modern software development. Yet, testing can mean a lot of things to different development teams. In the name of brevity, we'll only take a look at running the isolated high-level tests. 

## Test structure

Each test is going to test a single business requirement for our sample application. The following is an example of a test, taken from `main_test.go` in our sample application.

```go
func TestRespondsWithLove(t *testing.T) {

	pool, err := dockertest.NewPool("")
	require.NoError(t, err, "could not connect to Docker")

	resource, err := pool.Run("docker-gs-ping", "test", []string{})
	require.NoError(t, err, "could not start container")

	t.Cleanup(func() {
		require.NoError(t, pool.Purge(resource), "failed to remove container")
	})

	var resp *http.Response

	err = pool.Retry(func() error {
		resp, err = http.Get(fmt.Sprint("http://localhost:", resource.GetPort("8080/tcp"), "/"))
		if err != nil {
			t.Log("container not ready, waiting...")
			return err
		}
		return nil
	})
	require.NoError(t, err, "HTTP error")
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, resp.StatusCode, "HTTP status code")

	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	require.NoError(t, err, "failed to read HTTP body")

	// Finally, test the business requirement!
	require.Contains(t, string(body), "<3", "does not respond with love?")
}
```

As you can see, the test is using `ory/dockertest` library and it assumes that the Docker instance is running on the same machine where the test is being run.

The second test is very similar in nature but it is testing another business requirement of our application. You are welcome to have a look in `main_test.go`.

## Running locally

In order to run the tests, we must make sure that our application image is up-to-date.

```shell
docker build -t docker-gs-ping:test .
```

```
[+] Building 3.0s (13/13) FINISHED
...
```

In the above example we've omitted most of the output, only displaying the first line indicating that the build was successful.

Note, that the image is tagged with `test` which is the same label we've chosen to use in our `main_test.go` tests. There is no special significance to this tag, any word would do.

Now that the Docker image for our application had been built, we can run the tests that are using it.

```shell
go test ./...
ok      github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping       2.564s
```

That was a bit... underwhelming? Let's give it more detail, just to be sure.

```shell
go test -v ./...
```

```
=== RUN   TestRespondsWithLove
    main_test.go:47: container not ready, waiting...
--- PASS: TestRespondsWithLove (5.24s)
=== RUN   TestHealthCheck
    main_test.go:83: container not ready, waiting...
--- PASS: TestHealthCheck (1.40s)
PASS
ok      github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping       6.670s
```

So, the tests do, indeed, pass. Note, how retrying using exponential back-off helped avoiding failing tests while the containers are being initialised.

## Next steps

In this module, we took a look at setting up the tests for a containerised application. There are many different ways to test the application and we have considered the high-level, functional testing of business requirements only. This, however, feeds naturally into the next topic, where we are going to set up our functional tests to run in a pipeline.

In the next module, weâ€™ll take a look at how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. See:
