The Go getting started guide teaches you how to create a containerized Go application using Docker. In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:

* Create a simple Go application;
* Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Go image;
* Run the newly built image as a container;
* Set up a local development environment to connect a database to the container;
* Use Docker Compose to run the Go application;
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions.

After completing the Go getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own Go application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.

Let's get started!
