This tutorial provided very basic essentials for using Docker. If you want to
learn more about end-to-end development, start with the full install
instructions and feature overviews in the platform-specific guides, then follow
up with more advanced tutorials and user guides.

Depending on your interest, the Docker documentation contains a wealth of
information.  Here are some places to start:

* **[Docker Overview](/engine/docker-overview.md)**: More about Docker images,
  containers, and internals

* **[Define and deploy apps in swarm mode](/engine/getstarted-voting-app.md)**:
  Get started with [swarm mode](/engine/reference/glossary.md#swarm), Docker's
  orchestration model.

* **[Samples and labs](/samples/)**: A palette of sample applications and
  training labs from Docker and community contributors.

* **[Learn by example](/engine/tutorials/)**: A more in-depth exploration of
  concepts introduced in the basic getting started: running containers, building
  your own images, networking containers, managing data for containers, and
  storing images on Docker Hub.

* **Platform-specific Getting-Started guides**: Installation, release notes,
  basic command-line examplees, and more for your specific platform:

  - [Get started with Docker for Mac](/docker-for-mac/)
  - [Get started with Docker for Windows](/docker-for-windows/)
  - [Get started with Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview/) (legacy for older platforms)
  - [Get started with Docker for Linux](/engine/installation/linux/)
* **[Information about Docker products](http://www.docker.com/products)**:
  Information about the full line of Docker products and services.
