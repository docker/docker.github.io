Kitematic, the Docker GUI, runs on macOS and Windows operating systems. Beginning with the 1.8 Docker release, you use the Docker Toolbox to install Kitematic.  See the [macOS installation guide](/docker-for-mac/) or the [Windows installation guide](/docker-for-windows/) for details on installing with Docker Toolbox.

For information about using Kitematic, take a look at the [User Guide](userguide.md).
