If you find a typo or mismatch between the API and this documentation, please send us a pull request!


## Usage

To run it locally:

	git clone https://github.com/tutumcloud/cloud-api-docs.git
	make docs

The documentation will be available in http://localhost:8000/


## Updating the release HTML

As with the HTML generated by the DTR apidocs, the Docker Cloud documentation
needs to be generated and the resulting HTML commited into this repository.

After merging all PR's, run `make release`. This will place the updated HTML into
the `build` directory in your local `cloud-api-docs` repo.

Create a new Pull Request and get it merged. - now this repository is ready for the
release process using `docker/docs.docker.com`.

# Migrated info from ../README.md

## API Documentation Pull Requests

The API documentation for the Docker Cloud project is here

https://github.com/docker/cloud-docs

An extra step is needed when making PR's that modify the API - namely to add the generated HTML output to the PR by doing the following:

1. Make changes to the API's Markdown source.

2. Build the HTML for the API in your local branch.

  a. Change to the `cloud-api-docs` directory

      cd cloud-api-docs

  b. Generate the HTML

      make release

3. Add the Markdown together with the HTML to your pull request:

      $ git add apidocs/*

      $ git add docs

4. Push your changes to orgin.

5. Create a Pull request as you normally wouled.
