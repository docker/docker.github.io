## What is Bring Your Own License (BYOL)?

Bring Your Own License (BYOL) allows customers with existing software licenses
to easily migrate to the containerized version of the software you make
available on Docker Store.

To see and access an ISV's BYOL product listing, customers simply subscribe to
the product with their Docker ID. We call this **Ungated BYOL**.

ISVs can use the Docker Store/Hub as an entitlement and distribution platform.
Using APIâ€™s provided by Docker, ISVs can entitle users and distribute their
Dockerized content to many different audiences:

- Existing customers that want their licensed software made available as Docker containers.
- New customers that are only interested in consuming their software as Docker containers.
- Trial or beta customers, where the ISV can distribute feature or time limited software.

Docker provides a fulfillment service so that ISVs can programmatically entitle
users, by creating subscriptions to their content in Docker Store.

## Ungated BYOL

### Prerequisites and setup

To use Docker as your fulfillment service, an ISV must:
- [Apply and be approved as a Docker Store Vendor Partner](https://goto.docker.com/partners)
- Apply and be approved to list an Ungated BYOL product
- Create one or more Ungated BYOL product plans, in the Docker Store Publisher center.

## Creating an ungated BYOL plan

In Plans & Pricing section of the Publisher Center, ensure the following:
- Price/Month should be set to $0
- There should be no free trial associated with the product
- Under the Pull Requirements dropdown, "Subscribed users only" should be selected.
