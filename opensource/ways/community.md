With millions of Docker users all over the world, there's always someone who
needs a helping hand. Like many open source projects, the Docker project relies
on community support channels like forums, IRC, and StackOverflow.  You should
contribute mentoring if you have good knowledge of:

* how open source projects run
* using Docker in some particular domain (for example, testing or deployment)
* using Git, Go, GitHub, IRC, or other common tools

Also, choose mentoring if you like to be happy. Studies show that [helping others](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/03/five-minute-favor-adam-rifkin_n_3805090.html){: target="_blank" class="_"} is a great way to
boost your own well being.
