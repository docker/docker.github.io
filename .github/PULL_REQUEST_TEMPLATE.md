<!--Thanks for your contribution. Please use the following
guidelines to help us review it. You can remove these comments
as you fill out this template. -->

<!-- **Squash your commits**: Please use an
[interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
to squash (combine) multiple commits into a single commit, to keep the
commit history clean. The exception is when commits from multiple
contributors exist in the same pull request. In that case, one commit
per contributor is preferred, to keep the history clean but also give
credit for the work to all contributors. -->

### Describe the proposed changes

<!-- Tell us what you did and why. You can leave this off if
the PR title is descriptive. -->

### Project version

<!-- If this change only applies to a certain version of a project
(like Docker Engine 1.13), note that here. Also, consider adding
that info to the docs in your change, such as by adding
"In Docker 1.13 and higher..." or similar. -->

<!-- Also, DO NOT base your work on master if your change is only
relevant to an unreleased version of a project. Instead, base
your work on the `vnext-<PROJECT>` branch, which will be merged
into master when that project has a new release.-->
