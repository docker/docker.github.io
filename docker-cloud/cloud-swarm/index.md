Docker Cloud now allows you to connect to clusters
of Docker Engines running in v1.13
[swarm mode](/engine/swarm/).

With Beta Swarm Mode in Docker Cloud, you can
provision swarms to popular cloud providers, or
register existing swarms to Docker Cloud.
Use your Docker ID to authenticate and securely access
personal or team swarms.
