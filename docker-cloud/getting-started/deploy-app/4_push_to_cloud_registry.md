title: Push the image to Docker Cloud's registry
---

*Skip this step if you don't have Docker Engine installed locally.*

In this step you will take the image that you built in the previous step, and push it to Docker Cloud.

In step 2, you set your Docker Cloud username as an environment variable called **DOCKER_ID_USER**. If you skipped this step, change the `$DOCKER_ID_USER` to your Docker ID username before running this command.

First tag the image. Tags in this case denote different builds of an image.

**Python quickstart**
```bash
$ docker tag quickstart-python $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-python
```

**Go quickstart**
```bash
$ docker tag quickstart-go $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-go
```

Next, push the tagged image to the repository.

**Python quickstart**
```
$ docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-python
```

**Go quickstart**
```
$ docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/quickstart-go
```
## Verify the image location
After the push command completes, verify that the image is now in Docker Cloud's registry. Do this by running the `docker-cloud repository ls` command. You should see only one of the images below.

```
$ docker-cloud repository ls
NAME                                    DESCRIPTION
my-username/quickstart-python
my-username/quickstart-go
```

Next: [Deploy the app as a Docker Cloud service](5_deploy_the_app_as_a_service.md).
