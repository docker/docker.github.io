# Install DTR offline

The procedure to install Docker Trusted Registry on a node is the same,
whether that node has access to the internet or not.

The only difference when installing DTR on an offline node, is that instead
of pulling the DTR images from Docker Hub, you use a computer that is connected
to the internet to download a single package with all DTR images. Then you
copy that package to the nodes where youâ€™ll install DTR.

1.  Get the DTR package.

    Use a computer with internet access to download a single package with all
    Docker Datacenter components:

    ```none
    $ wget https://packages.docker.com/caas/ucp-1.1.2_dtr-2.0.3.tar.gz -O docker-datacenter.tar.gz
    ```

2.  Transfer the package to the offline node.

    Now that you have the DTR package file, transfer it to the node where you
    want to install Docker Trusted Registry. You can use the `scp` command
    for this.

    ```none
    $ scp docker-datacenter.tag.gz $USER@$DTR_HOST:/tmp
    ```

3.  Login into the host where you transferred the images.

4.  Load the UCP images.

    Once the package is on the node where you want to install DTR, you can use
    the `docker load` command, to load the images from the .tar file.

    ```none
    $ docker load < /tmp/docker-datacenter.tar.gz
    ```

5.  Install DTR.

    Now that the offline node has all the images needed to install UCP,
    you can [install DTR that host](index.md). Make sure to
    also copy the images to any other nodes you want to install DTR
    replicas onto.
