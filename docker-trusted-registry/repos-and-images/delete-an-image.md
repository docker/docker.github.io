To delete an image, go to the **DTR web UI**, and navigate to the image
**repository** you want to delete. In the **Tags** tab, select all the image
tags you want to delete, and click the **Delete button**.

in the image **repository**, navigate to the **Settings** tab, and click the
**Delete** button.
