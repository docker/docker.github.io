## Subscription Tiers

### What subscriptions levels are available for Docker?

[Docker Subscriptions](https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} come in three levels:
* Free plans for both individuals and development teams that include unlimited public repos.
* Docker Pro Subscriptions for individuals with unlimited private repos, unlimited public repos, no rate limiting on pull requests and premium support starting at $5 per month with an annual subscription.
* Docker Team Subscriptions for development teams with unlimited private repos and unlimited public repos starting at $25 per month for the first five users and $7 per month for each user thereafter with an annual subscription. The Team plan offers advanced collaboration and management tools, including organization and team management with role-based access controls.

### What are the differences between Free, Pro and Team Subscriptions?

Pro and Team subscriptions feature additional features, support, consumption levels and more. You can compare programs at the [Docker Pricing Page](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).

### How many seats do I need for my organization if I select a Team plan?

Your organization's number of paid seats must equal the number of organization members. If you're not using all of your organization's paid seats, you can downgrade to pay for fewer seats. Organization owners and members each fill a seat. If you've sent a pending invitation to a prospective organization member, the invitation will fill a seat.

### What are the rate limits for free subscriptions?

Anonymous and Free subscriptions are subject to rate limits on container image pull requests. You can get more information at the [Rate Limiting Information](../download-rate-limit.md#how-do-i-authenticate-pull-requests){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} page.

### We have a number of agents, users, and seats and it's difficult to track and manage the accounts. Can we get our organization IP addresses enabled for access instead?

We offer IP exclusions to allow for large organizations to use Docker platform services in diverse environments (developer laptops, CI systems, production systems, etc). Contact Docker Large Account sales for details and a price quote.

### What is a Docker ID? How do I get one?

A Docker ID is the core of a Docker subscription. You can get one for free at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}.

### I want to buy a large number of Docker Team Subscription seats. How do I do this?

Contact the [Docker Large Account Team](https://goto.docker.com/pricing-question.html) to buy a larger number of Docker Team Subscription seats.

### How do I access support? Do I have any extra benefits?

Docker Pro and Team subscribers have access to dedicated priority email support. All Docker subscribers (free and paid) have access to the Docker forums and Slack channels for community support.

### Do collaborator limits differ between the Free and Pro plans?

The Free plan includes unlimited collaborators for public repositories and zero collaborators for private repositories. Pro includes unlimited collaborators for public repositories and one unique collaborator for private repositories. Note that a collaborator on a private repository within a Pro plan can only be used with a service account. For details on the differences between plans, see the [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} page.

### Where can I renew my Docker Enterprise subscription?

The former Docker Enterprise product is now Mirantis Enterprise Platform. You can contact Mirantis for more information by visiting their [website](https://www.mirantis.com/){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}.

### Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### Can Docker Hub be used for free for open source projects?

Docker is a proud open source software company, and provides qualifying OSS software projects with access to Docker Hub with unlimited public repositories, unlimited consumption of OSS project container images, and unlimited collaborators at no cost. For questions about open source projects and pricing, visit the [Open Source Community Application](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application).
