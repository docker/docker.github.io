command: docker volume
short: Manage volumes
long: |
  The `docker volume` command has subcommands for managing data volumes. A data
  volume is a specially-designated directory that by-passes storage driver
  management.

  Data volumes persist data independent of a container's life cycle. When you
  delete a container, the Engine daemon does not delete any data volumes. You can
  share volumes across multiple containers. Moreover, you can share data volumes
  with other computing resources in your system.

  To see help for a subcommand, use:

      docker volume CMD help
