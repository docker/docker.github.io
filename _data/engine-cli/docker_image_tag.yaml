command: docker image tag
short: Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
long: "Assigns a new alias to an image in a registry. An alias refers to the\nentire
  image name including the optional `TAG` after the ':'. \n\n# OPTIONS\n**NAME**\n
  \  The image name which is made up of slash-separated name components, \n   optionally
  prefixed by a registry hostname. The hostname must comply with \n   standard DNS
  rules, but may not contain underscores. If a hostname is \n   present, it may optionally
  be followed by a port number in the format \n   `:8080`. If not present, the command
  uses Docker's public registry located at\n   `registry-1.docker.io` by default.
  Name components may contain lowercase \n   letters, digits and separators. A separator
  is defined as a period, one or\n   two underscores, or one or more dashes. A name
  component may not start or end \n   with a separator.\n\n**TAG**\n   The tag assigned
  to the image to version and distinguish images with the same\n   name. The tag name
  must be valid ASCII and may contain lowercase and\n   uppercase letters, digits,
  underscores, periods and hyphens. A tag name\n   may not start with a period or
  a hyphen and may contain a maximum of 128\n   characters.\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n## Tagging
  an image referenced by ID\n\nTo tag a local image with ID \"0e5574283393\" into
  the \"fedora\" repository with \n\"version1.0\":\n\n    docker image tag 0e5574283393
  fedora/httpd:version1.0\n\n## Tagging an image referenced by Name\n\nTo tag a local
  image with name \"httpd\" into the \"fedora\" repository with \n\"version1.0\":\n\n
  \   docker image tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0\n\nNote that since the tag name
  is not specified, the alias is created for an\nexisting local version `httpd:latest`.\n\n##
  Tagging an image referenced by Name and Tag\n\nTo tag a local image with name \"httpd\"
  and tag \"test\" into the \"fedora\"\nrepository with \"version1.0.test\":\n\n    docker
  image tag httpd:test fedora/httpd:version1.0.test\n\n## Tagging an image for a private
  repository\n\nTo push an image to a private registry and not the central Docker\nregistry
  you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).\n\n    docker image
  tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0\n"
