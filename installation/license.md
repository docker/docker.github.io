# License UCP

After installing Docker Universal Control Plane, you need to license your
installation. If you just want to try UCP, you can
[get a trial license](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

## Download your license

When your license is issued, you can download it on Docker Hub. On Docker Hub,
navigate to your profile settings. Then click the
[Licenses tab](https://hub.docker.com/account/licenses/).

## License your installation

Once you've downloaded the license file, you can apply it to your UCP
installation. On your browser, navigate to UCP, and then go to the **Settings
page**.

On the **License** page you can upload the new license.
