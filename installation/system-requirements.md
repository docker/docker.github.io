# UCP system requirements

Docker Universal Control Plane can be installed on-premises or on the cloud.
Before installing, be sure your infrastructure has these requirements.

## Hardware and software requirements

You can install UCP on-premises or on a cloud provider. To install UCP,
all nodes must have:

* 1.50 GB of RAM
* 3.00 GB of available disk space
* One of the supported operating systems installed:
  * RHEL 7.0, 7.1, or 7.2
  * Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
  * CentOS 7.1
  * SUSE Linux Enterprise 12
* Linux kernel version 3.10 or higher
* CS Docker Engine version 1.10 or higher

For highly-available installations, you also need a way to transfer files
between hosts.

## Ports used

When installing UCP on a host, make sure the following ports are open:

| Hosts              | Direction | Port                | Purpose                                                                    |

UCP collects anonymous usage metrics, to help us improve it. These metrics
are entirely anonymous, donâ€™t identify your company, users, applications,
or any other sensitive information. You can disable this when installing
or on the UCP settings screen.
