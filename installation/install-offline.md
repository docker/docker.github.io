# Install UCP offline

The procedure to install Docker Universal Control Plane on a host is the same,
whether that host has access to the internet or not.

The only difference when installing on an offline host,
is that instead of pulling the UCP images from Docker Hub, you use a
computer that is connected to the internet to download a single package with
all the images. Then you copy that package to the host where youâ€™ll install UCP.

## Step 1. Get the UCP package
Use a computer with internet access to download a single package with all UCP
images. As an example, to download UCP 1.1, run:

```bash
$ wget https://packages.docker.com/ucp/1.0/ucp-1.1.tar
```

## Step 2. Copy the package
Now that you have the UCP package file, transfer it to the host where you want
to install Docker UCP. You can use the `scp` command for this.

```bash
$ scp ./ucp-1.1.tar user@ucp-host:/tmp
```

## Step 3. Load the UCP images

Once the package is on the host where you want to install UCP, you can use
the `docker load` command, to load the images from the .tar file.

```bash
$ docker load < /tmp/ucp-1.1.tar
```

## Step 4. Install Docker UCP
Now that the offline host has all the images needed to install UCP,
you can [install Docker UCP that machine](install-production.md).
