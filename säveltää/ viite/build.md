```
Usage: build [options] [--build-arg key=val...] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --force-rm              Always remove intermediate containers.
    --no-cache              Do not use cache when building the image.
    --pull                  Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image.
    --build-arg key=val     Set build-time variables for one service.
```

Services are built once and then tagged as `project_service`, e.g.,
`composetest_db`. If you change a service's Dockerfile or the contents of its
build directory, run `docker-compose build` to rebuild it.
$ docker swarm unlock-key

To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-8jDgbUNlJtUe5P/lcr9IXGVxqZpZUXPzd+qzcGp4ZYA

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
