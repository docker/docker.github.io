<p>
 If Docker Trusted Registry is displaying a banner with the message:
</p>
<pre>
Cannot perform security scans because no vulnerability database was found
</pre>
<p>
 It means that the vulnerability database is empty, so it's not possible to scan your images for vulnerabilities. Make sure your node can reach
 <a class="link-https" href="https://dss-cve-updates.docker.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
  https://dss-cve-updates.docker.com/
 </a>
 , or

  download an offline version to update your vulnerability database
