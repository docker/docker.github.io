 <p>
  UCP 2.0.0 and above use the Docker Swarm functions built into the 1.12 CS Engine and higher, instead of the classic Docker Swarm method in earlier versions. This new implementation uses port 2377 by default.

 <p>
  Ensure that incoming port 2377 is available in addition to the existing ports opened for Docker Swarm communication. Your nodes should automatically connect to the controllers after opening the necessary ports, and the required UCP 2.0.0 containers will be deployed by the controllers onto those nodes.
