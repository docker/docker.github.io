 <p>
  It is possible to increase the maximum number of nodes on Docker Cloud. However, it is not possible to increase the number of nodes per cluster currently.

  As for increasing the size of nodes in an existing cluster, the only method to achieve that currently is to rebuild the cluster as the node size can only be adjusted during cluster creation.
