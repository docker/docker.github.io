<p>
 There are three types of volumes:
 <em>
  host
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  anonymous
 </em>
 , and
 <em>
  named:
 </em>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  A
  <strong>
   host volume
  </strong>
  lives on theÂ Docker host's filesystem and can be accessed from within the container. To create a host volume:
  <pre>
<code>docker run -v <span class="replaceabletext">/path/on/host</span>:<span class="replaceabletext">/path/in/container</span> ...</code></pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  An
  <strong>
   anonymous volume
  </strong>
  is useful for when you would rather have Docker handle where the files are stored. It can be difficult, however, to refer to the same volume over time when it is an anonymous volumes. To create an anonymous volume:
  <pre>
<code>docker run -v <span class="replaceabletext">/path/in/container</span> ...</code></pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  A
  <strong>
   named volume
  </strong>
  is similar to an anonymous volume. Docker manages where on disk the volume is created, but you give it a volume name. To create a named volume:
  <pre>
<code>docker volume create <span class="replaceabletext">somevolumename</span>
docker run -v <span class="replaceabletext">name</span>:<span class="replaceabletext">/path/in/container</span> ...</code></pre>
 </li>
</ul>
