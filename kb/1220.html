  What is the Docker Store?
 </h2>
 <p dir="ltr">
  The Store is the best way for you to distribute and sell your Dockerized content. Publish your software through the Docker Store to experience the benefits below:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li dir="ltr">
   <p dir="ltr">
    Access to Docker’s large and growing customer-base. Docker has experienced rapid adoption, and is wildly popular in dev-ops environments. Docker users have pulled images over four billion times, and they are increasingly turning to the Docker Store as the canonical source for high-quality, curated content.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   <p dir="ltr">
    Customers can try or buy your software, right from your product listing. Your content is accessible for installation, trial, and purchase from the Docker Store and the Docker CLI.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   <p dir="ltr">
    Use our licensing support.  We can limit access to your software to a) logged-in users, b) users who have purchased a license, or c) all Docker users.  We’ll help you manage and control your distribution.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   <p dir="ltr">
    We'll handle checkout.  You don’t have to set up your own digital e-commerce site when you sell your content through the Docker Store.  We'll even help you set pricing—and you can forget about the rest.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   <p dir="ltr">
    Seamless updates and upgrades.  We tell customers when your content has upgrades or updates available, right inside their Docker host product.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   It’s a win-win for our platform and publishers: great content improves our ecosystem, and our flexible platform helps you bring your content to market.
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
   Achieve the Docker Certified quality mark.  Publisher container images and plugins that meet the quality, security, and support criteria of the program will display a “Docker Certified” badge within the Docker Store and external marketing.
  </li>

  <p class="mt-indent-1">
   The Docker Store welcomes free and open-source content, as well as software sold directly by publishers.  We support the following commercial models:
  </p>

   </span>
   <h4 id="3-0">
    Paid-via-Docker Content
   </h4>
   <p class="mt-indent-2">
    This is content for which customers transact via Docker, as described in the publisher agreement.  Paid-via-Docker content includes both software than can be deployed on a host, as well as software that runs in the cloud and can be accessed by the customer via an ambassador container (containerized cloud services, for example).

  </h3>
  <p class="mt-indent-1" dir="ltr">
   The publishing process for the Docker Store is straightforward, and can be initiated from the landing page.  You can sign in with your Docker ID, and specify a product name and image source from a private repository.  We require that your product images are stored in private repositories via Docker Cloud and/or Hub, as they serve as an internal staging area from which you can revise and submit content for review.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-indent-1" dir="ltr">
   Once you specify a private-repository source for your product, you can provide the content-manifest items to populate your product’s details page.  These items include logos, descriptions, and licensing and support links so that customers can make informed decisions about your image.  These items are submitted alongside the image itself for moderation.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-indent-1" dir="ltr">
   The Docker Store team then conducts a comprehensive review of your image and metadata.  We use Docker Security Scanning to evaluate your product images’ security, and share results with you as the publisher.  During the image-moderation phase, we iterate back and forth with publishers to address outstanding vulnerabilities and content-manifest issues until the image is ready for publication.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-indent-1" dir="ltr">
   Commercial content and other supported images may qualify for the Docker Certified Container or Plugins quality mark.  The testing for this program goes beyond the vulnerability scan and also evaluates container images for Docker best practices developed over years of experience.  Collaborative support capability between Docker and the publisher is also established.  Please refer to the diagram below for a high-level summary:

   <h4 id="3-2">
    Choose a secure Base Image (see your Dockerfile's FROM: directive)
   </h4>
   <p class="mt-indent-2" dir="ltr">
    Many base images have a strong record of being secure, including:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li class="mt-indent-2">
     <a class="link-https" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/library/debian/tags/jessie/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
      Debian
     </a>
     Linux: both small and tightly-controlled, Debian-linux is a good alternative if you're currently using Ubuntu.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-indent-2">
     <a class="link-https" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
      Alpine
     </a>
     Linux: Alpine is a minimal linux distribution with an excellent security record.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-indent-2">
     Alpine-based application images: these include python:alpine, ruby:alpine, and golang:alpine. They are secure and minimal, while providing the convenience of their non-Alpine alternatives.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="mt-indent-2">
    Docker strongly recommends Alpine Linux. The founder of this Linux distribution is leading an initiative at Docker to provide safe, compact base images for all container applications.

   </span>
   <h4 id="3-3">
    Remove Unused Components
   </h4>
   <p class="mt-indent-2" dir="ltr">
    Often, vulnerabilities exist in components that aren't actually used in the containerized application.  To avoid this, you can:
   </p>
   <ul class="mt-indent-2">
    <li dir="ltr">
     <p dir="ltr">
      Follow best practices when using the apt-get command.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
     Make sure to run apt-get-remove to destroy any components required to build but not actually run your application.  Usually, this involves creating multi-line Dockerfile directives, as seen below.  The following example shows how to remove curl and python-pip after they are used to install the python requests package, all in a single Dockerfile directive:
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="mt-indent-2">
    <code>
     RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
     <br/>
     apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl python-pip &amp;&amp; \
     <br/>
     pip install requests &amp;&amp; \
     <br/>
     apt-get remove -y python-pip curl &amp;&amp; \
     <br/>
     rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/
    </code>
   </p>
   <p class="mt-indent-2">
    Keep in mind: any file introduced in one directive of your Dockerfile can only be removed in the same directive (and not in subsequent directives in your Dockerfile).

   <p class="mt-indent-2" dir="ltr">
    Your images are comprised of open-source libraries and packages that amass vulnerabilities over time and are consequently patched.  To optimize your product’s integrity, you must keep your images up-to-date:
   </p>
   <ul class="mt-indent-2">
    <li dir="ltr">
     <p dir="ltr">
      Periodically update your base image's version, especially if you’re using a version deemed to be vulnerable.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
     Re-build your image periodically.  Directives including commands such as apt-get install ... pull the latest versions of dependencies, which may include security fixes.

    Eliminating vulnerabilities is a trial-and-error process. To speed it up, consider using Docker Security Scanning on your own private Docker repositories in Docker Cloud and Docker Hub. This feature allows you to scan images you create on-demand, without relying on the scans provided by the Docker Publisher Program.

      <li>
       The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.  Its quantitative model ensures repeatable, accurate measurement while enabling users to see the underlying vulnerability characteristics that were used to generate the scores.  As a result, CVSS is well-suited as a standard measurement system for industries, organizations, and governments that need accurate and consistent vulnerability-impact scores.  CVSS is commonly used to prioritize vulnerability-remediation activities, and calculate the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on systems. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides CVSS scores for almost all known vulnerabilities.
