<p>
 When installing DTR 2.2.0 and higher on RHEL 7.2, the installation completes, but with the following warning:
</p>
<pre>
INFO[0189] Waiting for DTR to start... 
 
INFO[0194] Waiting for DTR to start... 

WARN[0199] Couldn't confirm authentication works, but still completing installation: Failed to wait for dtr to come back up: Polling failed with 30 attempts 5s apart: error making request to openid/begin Get https://example.com/api/v0/openid/begin: read tcp x.x.x.x:42258-&gt;x.x.x.x:443: read: connection reset by peer 

INFO[0199] Installation is complete </pre>
<p>
 If you receive this warning, check to see if the dtr-nginx container is continually restarting:
</p>
<pre>
{"level":"info","msg":"watching for changes to configtracker.configSpec{src:\"hub.yml\", writer:(configtracker.WriterFunc)(0x4e3030), templateFunc:(configtracker.TemplateFunc)(0x4e2700), cacheKey:\"5dec3f25-c638-45b4-a216-8b1e966d9a6d\"}","time":"2017-02-16T15:56:49Z"} 

{"level":"fatal","msg":"failed to run nginx: signal: killed","time":"2017-02-16T15:57:04Z"} 

*** /bin/nginxwrapper exited with status 1.</pre>
<p>
 If both of these conditions are met, you need to upgrade to seccomp 2.2.1, which is not installed with RHEL 7.2 by default.
</p>
<p>
 Download and manually install the newer version of libseccomp (2.2.1), install DTR, and then the dtr-nginx container will start successfully. Refer to
 <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/#passing-a-profile-for-a-container" rel="freeklink" title="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/#passing-a-profile-for-a-container">

 for details.
