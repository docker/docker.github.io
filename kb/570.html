 <p>
  Packet.net copies SSH keys into the created device, so you can upload to Packet.net's portal your own SSH public key and then SSH into the node with the user
  <code>
   root
  </code>
  . You can also get into the node with Packet's console. You can also use a container to copy your SSH keys into the node, as explained in
