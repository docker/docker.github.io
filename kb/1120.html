 <p>
  We are aware and actively working on an issue that occasionally prevents users from cancelling/downgrading subscription plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a workaround, Docker Support can cancel the subscription on your behalf. In order to help streamline this process, we ask users to
  <a class="link-https" href="https://support.docker.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://support.docker.com/">
   open a support case
  </a>
  providing/confirming the following information:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Name of the user account or organization with the subscription plan
  </li>
  <li>
   Be sure to open the ticket from an authorized billing contact
   <ul>
    <li>
     Email address on the support ticket has to correspond with the user account
    </li>
    <li>
     User account needs to be an owner account of organization (if requesting cancelling/downgrade of subscription on an organization)
    </li>
    <li>
     Email address on support ticket is also listed within the billing information
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   If downgrading subscription plans, please let us know which plan you would like to downgrade to
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After receiving this information Docker Support will be able to process your request in a timely manner.

  <strong>
   Note
  </strong>
  :
  <em>
   Upon cancelling a subscription plan, any private repositories will become locked, disabling pushing or pulling.
