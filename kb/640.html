  To assist you better, it is recommended that you provide a short summary of your Docker use case as well as a detailed description of the issue you are facing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, it helps speed the troubleshooting process when information about your Docker configuration and host environment is provided. For Docker EE, this can be done by using a UCP support dump, which is an archive that contains UCP system logs and diagnostic information. To obtain a support dump:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Log into the UCP UI with an administrator account.
 </li>
 <li>
  On the top-right menu, click your username, and choose
  <strong>
   Support Dump
  </strong>
  . An archive will be downloaded via your browser after a brief time interval.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 If the user interface is not accessible, you may perform the following steps instead to obtain a single-node version of the UCP support dump:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Obtain direct CLI access to the Docker daemon on a UCP manager node.
 </li>
 <li>
  Run the CLI support tool with the following command:
  <pre>
docker run --rm \
  --name ucp \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp:<span class="replaceabletext">2.1.4</span> \
  support &gt; docker-support-$HOSTNAME.tgz</pre>
 </li>
</ol>
