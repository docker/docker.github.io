 When you are using the wizard to add volumes you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Add both a container path and a host path in the
  <strong>
   add volume
  </strong>
  section.
 </li>
 <li>
  Click the
  <strong>
   add
  </strong>
  button.
 </li>
 <li>
  After the path is added, click the '
  <em>
   green checkmark
  </em>
  ' in the writable column to disable write.
 </li>
</ul>

{% endraw %}
