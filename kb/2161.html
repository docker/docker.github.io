<p>
 When trying to log into the UCP web UI using Safari, you might be prompted for a client certificate.
</p>
<p>
 This happens because UCP uses mutual TLS to ensure your data is kept safe. Most browsers, including Chrome and Firefox validate the TLS certificate presented by UCP, but don't send a client certificate to UCP, since that is optional.
</p>
<p>
 Safari behaves slightly differently and always tries to send a client certificate to UCP, so you're prompted to choose one. The problem is that none of the certificates in your Keychain are trusted by UCP, so when you select a certificate, UCP won't be able to validate it, and won't be able to establish a TLS connection.
</p>
<p>
 To solve this, you just need to tell Safari to not use any client certificate as shown here:

</p>
<p>
 If you already chose a certificate, Safari will save your preferences and automatically authenticate with the certificate you chose, so you need to clean your preferences and make Safari prompt you again for a choice:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Open
  <strong>
   Keychain Access
  </strong>
  from
  <strong>
   Applications
  </strong>
  &gt;
  <strong>
   Utilities
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  Select
  <strong>
   Login Keychain and All Items
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  Search for "identity preference"
 </li>
 <li>
  Find the entry corresponding to the UCP IP address or domain name, and delete it
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 When you try logging into UCP, you'll be prompted for a choice.
