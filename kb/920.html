 <p>
  This feature is not currently available on Docker Cloud as it's generally considered bad practice to commit running images to create new images, since there is no record of what was done within the image. We recommend either building the image locally on your own node or building them using the Automated Build service on Docker Cloud. You can read more about Docker Cloud's Automated Build features
