<p>
 On DTR 2.2.1, the
 <code>
  dtr-api
 </code>
 container has been known to steadily use memory until DTR is unavailable, even if the cluster is not busy.
</p>
<p>
 This has been resolved in DTR 2.2.3. Upgrading to DTR 2.2.3 will fix this issue. For details on upgrading DTR, refer to the following:
