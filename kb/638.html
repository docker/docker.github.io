  Resolution

 <p>
  You may need to revoke the GitHub access and then request access on your repos when relinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should do the following:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Unlink your GitHub account at Docker Hub:
   <a class="link-https" href="https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/">
    https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   Revoke the
   <strong>
    Docker Hub Registry
   </strong>
   application on your GitHub account:
   <a class="link-https" href="https://github.com/settings/applications" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
    https://github.com/settings/applications
    <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="26 clicks">
     26
    </span>
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   Link to your GitHub account again using
   <strong>
    Public &amp; Private Access
   </strong>
   :
   <a class="link-https" href="https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/">
    https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   On the
   <strong>
    Authorize Application
   </strong>
   page, make sure that all of the organizations you need access to have a green check mark, otherwise click the
   <strong>
    Request Access
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Note: There has been a change with the GitHub API, so public and private access is required at the moment. We do have an internal ticket open to fix the
  <strong>
   limited
  </strong>
  access.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, if you're using a GitHub organization, your profile on your organization's people page (
  <a class="link-https" href="https://github.com/orgs/**your-org**/people" rel="freeklink" title="https://github.com/orgs/**your-org**/people">
   https://github.com/orgs/**your-org**/people
  </a>
  ) has to be set to public.
 </p>
