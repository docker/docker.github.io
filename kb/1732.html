<p>
 When using a VM template to add a node to UCP, the status of the node in the UCP UI shows the node in a pending state. When accessing the dashboard, nodes may disappear as well.
</p>
<p>
 To successfully add the node to the cluster, check that the VM template doesn't include the
 <code>
  /etc/docker/key.json
 </code>
 file. If it is, remove it, and restart the Docker daemon. The
 <code>
  key.json
 </code>
 is used as the id of the node, and having multiple nodes with the same id will produce dashboard symptoms.
