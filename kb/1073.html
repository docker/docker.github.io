<p>
 When your company purchases a commercial subscription of Docker EE, there are two main contacts that interact with Docker Support: a
 <strong>
  Support Administrator
 </strong>
 and an
 <strong>
  Authorized Contact
 </strong>
 .
</p>
<p>
 A
 <strong>
  Support Administrator
 </strong>
 is a person at your company that is designated as the primary owner of the support relationship with Docker. A Support Administrator has permissions to add, remove, or modify an Authorized Contact. They will receive relevant product and service notifications from Docker.
</p>
<p>
 An
 <strong>
  Authorized Contact
 </strong>
 is a person that directly interfaces with Docker Support to ask questions or report issues by submitting a support request. Depending on your level of support, your company may designate up to four (
