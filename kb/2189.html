 <p>
  Docker Technical Support has asked me to create and upload a "Support Dump." What is that, and how do I create one?

  Prerequisites
 </h2>
 <p>
  Before performing these steps, you must meet the following requirements:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Docker Enterprise Edition - Standard or Advanced
  </li>
  <li>
   Also known as EE Standard or EE Advanced
  </li>
 </ul>

  Steps
 </h2>
 <p>
  A Docker Support Dump helps speed the troubleshooting process by gathering information about your Docker configuration and host environment. For Docker EE - Standard or Advanced, this can be done by using a UCP support dump, which creates an archive containing UCP system logs and diagnostic information.
 </p>
 <p>
  To obtain a support dump:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Log into the UCP UI with an administrator account.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the top-right menu, click your username, and choose
   <strong>
    Support Dump
   </strong>
   . An archive will be downloaded via your browser after a brief time interval.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  If the user interface is not accessible, you may perform the following steps instead to obtain a single-node version of the UCP support dump:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Obtain direct CLI access to the Docker daemon on a UCP manager node.
  </li>
  <li>
   Run the CLI support tool with the following command. Be sure to replace
   <code>
    HOSTNAME
   </code>
   with the canonical hostname of the system where you are running the command, and replace the version number after
   <code>
    docker/ucp
   </code>
   with the version of UCP you are running.
   <pre>
docker run --rm \
  --name ucp \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp:<span class="replaceabletext">2.1.4</span> \
  support &gt; docker-support-<span class="replaceabletext">HOSTNAME</span>.tgz</pre>
  </li>
 </ol>
</div>
