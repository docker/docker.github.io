 <p>
  You can check on the reason for the failed transaction by
  <a class="link-https" href="https://support.docker.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://support.docker.com/">
   opening a support case
  </a>
  . The most common reason for failed transactions is due to the credit card company rejecting the transaction. If this is the case, call your credit card company and ask them to approve the transaction. Alternatively, you can switch to another card by updating your billing information.
