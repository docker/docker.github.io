 <p>
  Deleting your Docker Hub/Cloud account will permanently remove your account and cannot be recovered.
  <strong>
   Your Docker Hub/Cloud account may also be linked to other Docker products and services, so deleting your account will also disable access to those products and services.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Before submitting a request to delete your account, please complete the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Delete all public and private repositories for this account.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you have a subscription plan, cancel any active subscriptions on Docker Hub and Docker Cloud and confirm that your account has been downgraded to the
   <strong>
    free
   </strong>
   plan.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you belong to an organization, remove your account from all organizations. If you are the sole owner of any organization, either add someone to the "
   <strong>
    owners
   </strong>
   " team and then remove yourself from the organization
   <strong>
    or
   </strong>
   submit a request to delete the organization as well.
