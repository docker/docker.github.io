<p>
 Docker's general policy regarding security reports can be found here:
 <a class="link-https" href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">
  https://github.com/docker/docker/blo...ONTRIBUTING.md
 </a>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If you discover a security vulnerability, please bring it to Docker's attention right away!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Please
 <em>
  <u>
   DO NOT
  </u>
 </em>
 file a public issue, instead send your report privately to
 <a class="link-mailto" href="mailto:security@docker.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="mailto:security@docker.com">
  security@docker.com
 </a>
 .
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Security reports are greatly appreciated, and Docker will publicly thank you for it. Docker also likes to send gifts—if you're into Docker branded merchandise, please let us know.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Docker currently does not offer a paid security bounty program, but we are not ruling it out in the future.
