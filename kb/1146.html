<p>
 When I try to deploy with a stack file wtih Docker Cloud, I get the following error message:
</p>
<pre>
<code>Unexpected error executing docker command create_container: 'ascii' codec can't encode character 'some-character' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)</code></pre>
<p>
 If you get this error message, double check your stack file and make sure that there isn't any extra spaces or hidden characters.
</p>
