  <span>
   I just configured a service and cannot find the "number of containers" slider that allows scaling. Has it been moved somewhere or have I misconfigured something and hence I don't have the option to scale the service to multiple containers?

 <p>
  Check if the EVERY_NODE deployment strategy was selected when creating the service, since using this deployment strategy prevents manual scaling. A service with an EVERY_NODE strategy will have one container deployed on each node that matches its deploy tags. It has the following properties:
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li type="disc">
   With every new node that matches the service’s deploy tags, a new container will be deployed to it.
  </li>
  <li type="disc">
   <strong>
    It cannot be manually scaled.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li type="disc">
   If the service uses volumes, each container on each node will have a different volume.
  </li>
  <li type="disc">
   If the service is linked from another service with EVERY_NODE strategy, containers will be linked one-to-one on each node.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Note: Currently it is not possible to change from EVERY_NODE to HIGH_AVAILABILITY or EMPTIEST_NODE and vice versa, so a new service would need to be created in order to use the new deployment strategy.
