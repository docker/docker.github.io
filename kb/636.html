 Account renames have been temporarily suspended due to system migration. To change your Docker username, make a copy of your existing images, request your old Docker account to be disabled, create a new Docker username, and restore your images and Automatic Builds to your new Docker account.

  Preparation
 </h3>
 <p>
  Before requesting your old Docker username to be disabled:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Download any images (and tags) you wish to keep by running the following command:
   <code>
    docker pull -a &lt;image&gt;
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="https://success.docker.com/Cloud/Solve/How_do_I_delete_a_repository%3F" rel="internal" target="_blank" title="How Do I Delete a Repository">
    Delete all repositories
   </a>
   associated with your account.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you have an active Docker subscription, downgrade to the free plan.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you have a license key,
   <a href="https://success.docker.com/KBase/How_do_I_download_my_Docker_license_key%3F" rel="internal" target="_blank" title="How to download your Docker license key">
    download the key
   </a>
   from your Docker Hub account. The download link will no longer be available after the rename.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you belong to an organization, remove yourself from the organization.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you are the sole owner of an organization, either remove yourself from the organization or add someone to the "owners" team and then remove yourself from the organization.
  </li>
  <li>
   Unlink your Github and Bitbucket accounts.
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
  Once you have completed the preparation steps, contact Support to disable your Docker username. If you have a current subscription, go to the
  <a class="link-https" href="https://support.docker.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://support.docker.com">
   Docker Support Site
  </a>
  . Otherwise, go to the
  <a href="/Help" rel="internal" target="_blank" title="Customer Service">
   Customer Service Request
  </a>
  form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Docker Support will then proceed to deactivate your account, remove the associated email addresses, and notify you when you can create a new account. Once your email address has been removed from the old account, you may then proceed with creating a new account using that email address.

  After creating your new account, you can restore images and add additional email addresses to the account.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Run
   <code>
    docker tag
   </code>
   for all of your images with your new account name.
  </li>
  <li>
   Run
   <code>
    docker push
   </code>
   for each of your images to push to your new Docker Hub account.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you created any Automated Builds, recreate them on the new account.
  </li>
  <li>
   Add any additional email addresses to the account.
