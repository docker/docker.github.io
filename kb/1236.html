  About btrfs and Docker
 </h3>
 <p>
  Btrfs (pronounced better-fs) is a highly advanced and fully stable Linux filesystem that offers many compelling and useful features like Copy-On-Write, snapshotting, Raiding, and thin provisioning. Btrfs is the default filesystem on some systems like SuSE / SLES and is being used by some very large financial organizations today. Within Docker, support for Btrfs is available in the form of a storage driver as of 1.10 (both open source and commercially supported versions). While SuSE / SLES include btrfs as the default filesystem, it can be installed on almost every other Linux flavor like Debian / Ubuntu and Red Hat / CentOS systems. With the problems we see in using devicemapper and questions as to devicemapper's maintainability given that OverlayFS seems to be gaining more focus and attention, btrfs seems like a very good replacement for devicemapper on Red Hat based systems as Docker's preferred storage driver.

  Working with btrfs
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the sections below, we shall see how easy it is to work with btrfs and specifically how to recover from disk out-of-space issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  What we'll use here is a stock Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS system. We'll install Docker 1.11, the btrfs package, configure Docker to use btrfs as the storage driver. We will then simulate a disk out-of-space issue and then look at steps to recover from it without losing any data or applications running on the system. For the purposes of understanding all commands are typed out by hand, and it is urged that these manual steps are automated to make the entire recovery process more reliable.

  Btrfs Quickstart
 </h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    Let's login to our Ubuntu 14.04 box and check if btrfs is installed and available. Since, we will be dealing with making changes to filesystems it will be convenient to run all commands as root (or use sudo to prefix all commands).
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs
The program 'btrfs' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
apt-get install btrfs-tools
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
   <p>
    Expectedly, btrfs is not installed on this Ubuntu system
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Let's install btrfs as shown in the output message above
   </p>

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Now the btrfs command should work:
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs --version
Btrfs v3.12
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Also, ensure that the current version of docker is installed. The simplest way to get docker up and running is
    <code>
     curl -fsSL
     <a class="link-https" href="https://get.docker.com" rel="freeklink" title="https://get.docker.com">
      https://get.docker.com
     </a>
     | sh
    </code>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Btrfs works with block devices, so we would need one. Let's see what all block devices are attached to this system, using the
    <code>
     lsblk
    </code>
    command:
   </p>
   <pre>
root@m1-host:-# lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
root@m1-host:-#</pre>
   <p>
    There are no unpartitioned block devices on this system. The only one is the one on which the OS is installed. We need to add another one.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since this is an AWS instance, I'm attaching two EBS instances, each 4GB in size.
   </p>
   <p>
    Running
    <code>
     lsblk
    </code>
    command now should reflect the new block devices added.
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# lsblk

root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    We need to change docker to use
    <code>
     btrfs
    </code>
    as the storage driver. Currently (as the default on Ubuntu), docker is using
    <code>
     extfs
    </code>
    as indicated by the output of
    <code>
     docker info | grep -i filesystem
    </code>
   </p>
   <pre>
root@m1-host:-# docker info | grep Filesystem
WARNING: No swap limit support
 Backing Filesystem: extfs
root@m1-host:-#</pre>
   <p>
    So, let's shut down docker before we make any changes using
    <code>
     service docker stop
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Note: This is assuming that this is a brand new docker installation and there are no images that need to be preserved. If there are, then those images would need to be either pushed to the hub / DTR or exported into tar files and backed up in some fashion.

 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    Let's format the first disk
    <code>
     xvdx
    </code>
    to use the btrfs filesystem. The wonderful aspect of this exercise is that btrfs behaves as a logical volume manager and as such there is no need to partition the disk or anything. We could partition the disk if we really wanted to, and not because btrfs needed it. We'll use
    <code>
     mkfs.btrfs
    </code>
    for this task.
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/xvdx

WARNING! - Btrfs v3.12 IS EXPERIMENTAL

    Now that the btrfs filesystem has been created, let's mount it on the same path that docker uses as the root for all containers, images and volumes on the host which is
    <code>

    .

  Managing Disk Space Issues and Performance
 </h3>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    Occasionally, we can expect to face 'out of disk space' issues, especially when dealing with big images or with images that have multiple tags and a CI / CD or automation system that could overwhelm the amount of available disk space. Handling disk space issues in Btrfs is actually quite trivial and it does not even require a restart of anything. Extending a volume with an additional device is as easy as running a single command on btrfs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this section, we'll simulate conditions for an out of disk space condition and use btrfs to address it and see that docker continues to function with no hiccups
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>

   Let's simulate some very large Docker containers using the
   <code>
    fallocate

    Btrfs' Logical Volume Management to the rescue. It is quite trivial now to easily expand our docker base directory (or btrfs volume, aptly) across additional, multiple disks. All it takes is a single command and an available block device to extend the volume upon. When we created
    <code>
     xvdx
    </code>
    , we also created an additional EBS device
    <code>
     xvdy
    </code>
    . We will now use this unformatted block device to extend the existing
    <code>
     /var/lib/docker
    </code>
    volume, as shown below. Once we do this, it is recommended to "balance" the data across the multiple disks to offer resilience and improve performance.
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs device add /dev/xvdy /var/lib/docker/
root@m1-host:-# df -lkh /var/lib/docker
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvdx       8.0G  3.6G  4.1G  47% /var/lib/docker
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
   <p>
    The output of
    <code>
     df -lkh
    </code>
    shows only 47% used as opposed to 99% used earlier when the volume was mounted on a single device. Matter of fact, when using Btrfs, the usual unix commands
    <code>
     df
    </code>
    etc would not show accurate information due to the way Btrfs uses RAID. Therefore, a more accurate representation of disk free space can be derived using
    <code>
     btrfs filesystem df /var/lib/docker
    </code>
    . The
    <code>
     filesystem
    </code>
    in the command may be shortened to
    <code>
     fi
    </code>
    as shown below:
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs fi df /var/lib/docker
Data, single: total=3.57GiB, used=3.51GiB
System, DUP: total=8.00MiB, used=16.00KiB

Metadata, single: total=8.00MiB, used=0.00

   <p>
    Now, new images can be pulled and we can run containers without any disk space issues:
   </p>

    As mentioned earlier, for better performance and resilience, it is a recommended practice that the disks be balanced. We can see that the disks are not balanced as most of the data was written to the first disk only. This is shown using

  Summary
 </h3>
 <p>
  We were able to see how Btrfs' powerful features allows us to manage disk space issues and improve performance and resiliency through the inbuilt RAID support. BTRFS is an advanced and future generation file system and fits very well with Docker's way of working. Since Btrfs treats all disks as a logical volume, it is trivial to extend volumes using a single command and it takes effect without the need to restart docker or make any other configuration changes.
