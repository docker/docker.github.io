<p>
 The keys used for communication over TLS in swarm mode are Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) keys created with a length of 256 bits. The strength of anÂ Elliptic Curve key of 256 bits is roughly equivalent to that of a 3072-bit RSA key. You can check the strength of your swarm keys yourself by looking at the files located on a Swarm manager in
 <code>
  /var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/*
 </code>
 and viewing the details of your Swarm certificates with the
 <code>
  openssl
 </code>
 command. For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sudo openssl x509 -text -in /var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.crt</code></pre>
<p>
 This will tell you about the certificates used for swarm mode, as well as the encryption type and key strength used for Swarm mode.
