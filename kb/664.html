 <p>
  The only way to take a repository that is not an automated build and make it into a regular repository is to delete the automated build repo and then re-create the repository as a normal one.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can pull all the tags associated with this repository, remove the automated build, and then re-push everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  To delete the build, log in to
  <a class="external" href="http://hub.docker.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="http://hub.docker.com/">
   hub.docker.com
  </a>
  and click on the "Details" for the automated build you'd like to delete. Next, click on "Settings". Finally, choose the "Delete" option.
