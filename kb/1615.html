<p>
 When trying to install, join, or restore a DTR replica, you might get the following error:
</p>
<pre>
Failed to create new container</pre>
<p>
 There are multiple instances when you might receive this error. To debug this, check the constraints mentioned. They could look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
Failed to create new container dtr-nginx-12a34b56c78d: Couldn't create container 'dtr-nginx-12a34b56c78d' from image 'docker/dtr-nginx:2.0.4': Error response from daemon: Unable to find a node that satisfies the following conditions
[port 80 (Bridge mode) port 443 (Bridge mode)]
[available container slots]
[container!=ucp-controller (soft=false) container!=dtr-api-* (soft=false)]
[node==node1]</pre>

  Solution

 <p>
  The error could be caused by any of the constraints mentioned in the console output. Try the following:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Check that the node name mentioned in the constraints and ensure that it matches the name of the node listed in the UCP dashboard's
   <strong>
    Node
   </strong>
   page.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure the ports mentioned are not currently in use by another process or container.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you see the line
   <font color="#515656" face="monospace, monospace">
    container!=dtr-api-*
   </font>
   , check your UCP's
   <strong>
    Admin Settings
   </strong>
   page. Under the
   <strong>
    Scheduler
   </strong>
   settings, ensure the option "
   <strong>
    Allow Administrators to deploy containers on UCP controllers or nodes running DTR
   </strong>
   " is checked.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the unlikely event that all three steps above are already verified and the issue still cannot be resolved, file a support ticket to further investigate the issue.
  </li>
 </ol>
