  Answer
 </h2>
 <p>
  Only users who are given explicit permission are able to push/pull in a private repository. All other users are not able to even search or view the repository.
 </p>
 <p>
  For single user accounts, other users can be added as "collaborators" to a private repository as shown below. Collaborators are able to push and pull from those repositories.

 </p>
 <p>
  For organization accounts, specific teams can be given access to specific private repositories as shown below. The permissions granted to each team will determine what they are able to do with that particular repository. The organization's "owners" team has access to all of the organizations repositories.
