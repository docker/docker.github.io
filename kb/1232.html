<p>
 To connect to the host system from inside a container, setup a bridge network with a staticÂ IP address accessible from within the container.
</p>
<p>
 For example, if your host system is Mac OS X:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Go into
  <strong>
   Network
  </strong>
  under
  <strong>
   System Preferences
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Click on the gear icon and choose
  <strong>
   Manage Virtual Interfaces
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Click on the
  <strong>
   +
  </strong>
  button and choose
  <strong>
   New Bridge
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Give it a name and do *NOT* include any other interfaces on your system.
 </li>
 <li>
  Click
  <strong>
   Create
  </strong>
  . It will appear in the list of your interfaces on the left in the
  <strong>
   Network
  </strong>
  panel.
 </li>
 <li>
  Click on it, and change
  <strong>
   Configure IPv4
  </strong>
  from
  <strong>
   Using DHCP
  </strong>
  to
  <strong>
   Manually
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Enter an IP that will not conflict with any network you might connect to into the
  <strong>
   IP Address
  </strong>
  field. Click
  <strong>
   Apply
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 This works because as your traffic exits the container, the normal OSX routing rules are applied, and that IP address is locally available.
