 <p>
  Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE) is the enterprise container platform from Docker to be used across the entire software supply chain. It is a fully-integrated solution for container-based application development, deployment, and management. With integrated end-to-end security, Docker EE enables application portability by abstracting your infrastructure so that applications can move seamlessly from development to production.

 <p>
  This reference architecture describes a standard, production-grade, Docker EE deployment. It also details the components of Docker EE, how they work, how to automate deployments, how to manage users and teams, how to provide high availability for the platform, and how to manage the infrastructure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some environment-specific configuration details are not be provided. For instance, load balancers vary greatly between cloud platforms and on-premises infrastructure platform. For these types of components, general guidelines to environment-specific resources are provided.

  Understanding Docker Components
 </h2>
 <p>
  From development to production, Docker EE provides a seamless platform for containerized applications both on-premises and on the Cloud. Docker EE is available in three tiers to meet different application needs. Both Docker EE Standard (formerly known as Docker Datacenter) and Docker EE Advanced include the following components:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Docker CS Engine, the commercially supported Docker Engine
  </li>
  <li>
   Universal Control Plane (UCP), the web-based, unified cluster and application management solution
  </li>
  <li>
   Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), a resilient and secure image management repository
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Together they provide an integrated solution with the following design goals:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Agility — the Docker API is used to interface with the platform so that operational features do not slow down application delivery
  </li>
  <li>
   Portability — the platform abstracts details of the infrastructure for applications
  </li>
  <li>
   Control — the environment is secure by default, provides robust access control, and logging of all operations
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To achieve these goals the platform must be resilient and highly available. This reference architecture demonstrates this robust configuration.

  <p>
   The building block of Docker EE, the Docker Commercially Supported Engine (CS Engine) is responsible for container-level operations, interaction with the OS, providing the Docker API, and running the Swarm cluster. The Engine is also the integration point for infrastructure, including the OS resources, networking, and storage.

   Universal Control Plane
  </h3>
  <p>
   UCP extends CS Engine by providing an integrated application management platform. It is both the main interaction point for users and the integration point for applications. UCP runs an agent on all nodes in the cluster to monitor them and a set of services on the
   <em>
    controller nodes
   </em>
   . This includes
   <em>
    identity services
   </em>
   to manage users,
   <em>
    Certificate Authorities
   </em>
   (CA) for user and cluster PKI, the main
   <em>
    controller
   </em>
   providing the Web UI and API, data stores for UCP state, and a
   <em>
    Classic Swarm
   </em>
   service for backward compatibility.

   The DTR is an application managed by, and integrated with UCP, that provides Docker images distribution and security services. The DTR uses UCP's identity services to provide Single Sign-On (SSO), and establish a mutual trust to integrate with its PKI. It runs as a set of services on one or several
   <em>
    replicas
   </em>
   : the

  <h3 id="2-3">
   Swarm Mode
  </h3>
  <p>
   To provide a seamless cluster based on a number of nodes, DDC relies on CS Engine's
   <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
    <em>
     swarm mode
    </em>
   </a>
   capability. Swarm mode divides nodes between
   <em>
    workers
   </em>
   , nodes running application workloads defined as services, and
   <em>
    managers
   </em>
   , nodes in charge of maintaining desired state, managing the cluster's internal PKI, and providing an API. Managers can also run workloads. In a Docker EE environment they run UCP controllers and shouldn't run anything else.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Swarm mode service model provides a declarative desired state for workloads, scalable to a number of
   <em>
    tasks
   </em>
   (the service's containers), accessible through a stable resolvable name, and optionally exposing an end-point. Exposed services are accessible from any node on a cluster-wide reserved port, reaching tasks through the
   <em>
    routing mesh
   </em>
   , a fast routing layer using high-performance switching in the Linux kernel. This set of features enable internal and external discoverability for services, UCP's
   <em>
    HTTP Routing Mesh
   </em>
   (HRM) adding hostname-to-service mapping.

  A Standard Deployment Architecture
 </h2>
 <p>
  This section demonstrates a standard, production-level architecture for Docker EE using 10 nodes: 3 UCP controllers, 3 nodes for the DTR, and 4 worker nodes for application workloads. The number of worker nodes is arbitrary, most environments will have more depending on applications needs, it doesn't change the architecture or the cluster configuration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Access to the environment is done through 3 Load Balancers (or 3 load balancer virtual hosts) with corresponding DNS entries for the UCP controllers, the DTR replicas, and the applications running in the cluster.
 </p>
 <p>
  The DTR replicas use shared storage for images. S3-compatible object storage (the default) and NFS storage are both covered in this section.

  <span id="Node_Size">
  </span>
  <h3 id="2-4">
   Node Size
  </h3>
  <p>
   A node is a machine in the cluster (virtual or physical) with Docker Engine running on it. When provisioning each node, assign it a role: UCP Controller, DTR, or worker node so that they are protected from running application workloads.
  </p>
  <p>
   To decide what size the node should be in terms of CPU, RAM, and storage resources, consider the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    All nodes should at least fulfill the minimal requirements for UCP 2.0: 2 GB of RAM and 3 GB of storage. More detailed requirements are in the
    <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/installation/system-requirements/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
     UCP documentation
    </a>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    UCP Controller nodes should be provided with more than the minimal requirements but won't need much more if nothing else runs on them.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ideal Worker nodes size will vary based on your workloads, so it is impossible to define a universal standard size.
   </li>
   <li>
    Other considerations like target density (average number of container per node), whether one standard node type or several are preferred, and other operational considerations might also influence sizing.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   If possible, node size should be determined by experimentation and testing actual workloads, and they should be refined iteratively. A good starting point is to select a standard or default machine type in your environment and use this size only. If your standard machine type provides more resources than the UCP Controllers need, it makes sense to have a smaller node size for these. Whatever the starting choice, it's important to monitoring resource usage and cost to improve the model.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two example scenarios:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    One standard node size: 2 VCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB storage
   </li>
   <li>
    Two node sizes: 2 VCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB storage for UCP Controllers and 4 VCPU, 64 GB RAM, 40 GB storage for worker nodes
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Depending on your OS of choice, storage configuration for Docker Engine might require some planning. Refer to
   <a href="https://success.docker.com/Policies/Compatibility_Matrix" rel="internal">
    the Support Matrix
   </a>
   to see what
   <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">

  <span id="Load_Balancers">
  </span>
  <h3 id="2-5">
   Load Balancers
  </h3>
  <p>
   Load balancers configuration should be done before installation, including the creation of DNS entries. Most load balancers should work with Docker EE. The only requirements are TCP passthrough and the ability to do health checks on an HTTPS endpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
   In our example architecture, the three UCP controllers ensure UCP resiliency in case of node failure or controller reconfiguration. Access to UCP through the GUI or API is always done using TLS. The load balancer is configured for simple TCP pass-through on port 443, using a custom HTTPS health check at
   <code>
    https://&lt;ucp_controller&gt;/_ping
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Be sure to create a DNS entry for the UCP host such as
   <code>
    ucp.example.com
   </code>
   and point to the load balancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The setup for the three DTR replicas is similar to setting up the UCP controllers. Again, use TCP pass-through to port 443 on the nodes, except the health check is at
   <code>
    https://&lt;dtr_replica_node&gt;/health
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Create a DNS entry for the DTR host such as
   <code>
    dtr.example.com
   </code>
   and point it to the load balancer. It's important to keep it as concise as possible because it will be part of the full name of images. For example,
   <code>
    user_a
   </code>
   's
   <code>
    webserver
   </code>
   image will be named
   <code>
    dtr.example.com/user_a/webserver
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The application load balancer provides access to services HTTP endpoints exposed through UCP's HTTP Routing Mesh (HRM). HRM provides a reverse-proxy to map domain names to services that expose ports and are attached to the
   <code>
    ucp-hrm
   </code>
   overlay network. As an example, the
   <code>
    voting
   </code>
   application exposes the
   <code>
    vote
   </code>
   service's port
   <code>
    80
   </code>
   . The HRM maps
   <code>
    <a class="external" href="http://vote.apps.example.com" rel="freeklink" title="http://vote.apps.example.com">
     http://vote.apps.example.com
    </a>
   </code>
   to this port on the
   <code>
    ucp-hrm
   </code>
   overlay network, and the application LB itself maps
   <code>
    *.apps.example.com
   </code>
   to nodes in the cluster.
  </p>

  <span id="DTR_Storage">
  </span>
  <h3 id="2-6">
   DTR Storage
  </h3>
  <p>
   The DTR usually needs to store a large number of images. It uses external storage (S3, NFS, etc.), not node storage so that it can be shared between DTR replicas. The DTR replicates metadata and configuration information between replicas, but not image layers themselves. To determine storage size, start with the size of the existing images used in the environment and evolve from there.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's best to use an existing storage solution in your environment so that image storage can benefit from existing operations experience. If you have to chose a new solution, consider using S3-compatible object storage, which maps more closely to registry operations.

  Recommendations for the Docker EE Installation
 </h2>
 <p>
  This section details the installation process for the architecture and provide a checklist. It is not a substitute for the documentation, which provides more details and is authoritative in any case. The goal is to help you define a repeatable (and ideally automated) process to deploy, configure, upgrade and expand your Docker EE environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three main stages of a Docker EE Standard or Advanced installation are as follows:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Deploying and configuring the infrastructure (hosts, network, storage)
  </li>
  <li>
   Installing and configuring the Docker Engine, running as an application on the hosts
  </li>
  <li>
   Installing and configuring UCP and the DTR, delivered as containers running on the Engine
  </li>
 </ol>

   <p>
    Access to Docker EE is done using port 443 only (ports 443 and 80 for DTR), whether it's to access the Web UI or the remote API. This makes external firewall configuration simple. In most cases you only need to open ports 80, 443, and 22. Port 22 is for SSH access is optional since Docker EE doesn't require SSH access. Access to applications is through a load balancer using HTTPS. If you expose other TCP services to the outside world, open these ports on the firewall. As explained in the previous section, several ports need to be open for communication inside the cluster. If you have a firewall between some nodes in the cluster, for example, to separate controllers from worker nodes, open the relevant port there too.

   <ol>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Clock synchronization

    <li>
     <strong>
      Static IPs
     </strong>
     are required for UCP for all hosts.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Hostnames
     </strong>
     are used for node identification in the cluster. The hostname must be set in an non-ephemeral way.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Host firewalls

   <p>
    Once the installation has finished for the first controller node, the two additional controllers must be installed by joining them to the cluster. UCP configures a full controller replica on the manager node in the cluster, so the only command needed on the two controllers is a
    <code>
     docker swarm join
    </code>
    with the right token. The exact command can be obtained by running
    <code>
     docker swarm join-token manager
    </code>
    on the first controller.
   </p>
   <p>
    To join the worker nodes, the equivalent command can be obtained with
    <code>
     docker swarm join-token worker
    </code>
    on any controller:
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>docker swarm join-token worker
</code></pre>
   <p>
    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
   </p>
   <pre>
<code>docker swarm join \
--token SWMTKN-1-00gqkzjo07dxcxb53qs4brml51vm6ca2e8fjnd6dds8lyn9ng1-092vhgjxz3jixvjf081sdge3p \

   Validating the Deployment
  </h3>
  <p>
   When installation of everything has finished, tests can be done to validate the deployment. Disable scheduling of workloads on UCP controllers and nodes running the DTR.
  </p>
  <p>
   Basic tests to consider:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Log in through
    <code>
     <a class="link-https" href="https://ucp.example.com" rel="freeklink" title="https://ucp.example.com">
      https://ucp.example.com
     </a>
    </code>
    as well as directly to a manager node, eg.
    <code>
     <a class="link-https" href="https://manager1.example.com" rel="freeklink" title="https://manager1.example.com">
      https://manager1.example.com
     </a>
    </code>
    . Make sure the cluster and all nodes are healthy.
   </li>
   <li>
    Test that you can deploy an application following
    <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/applications/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
     the example in the documentation
    </a>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Test that users can download a bundle and connect to the cluster from the CLI. Test that they can use
    <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
     docker-compose
    </a>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Test DTR with a full image workflow. Make sure storage isn't misconfigured and images are stored in the right place.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Consider building a standard automated test suite to validate new environments and updates. Just testing standard functionality should hit most configuration issues. Make sure you run these tests with a non-admin user, the test user should have similar rights as users of the platform. Measuring time taken by each test can also pinpoint issues with underlying infrastructure configuration. Fully deploying an actual application from your organization should be part of this test suite.

  High Availability in Docker EE
 </h2>
 <p>
  In a production environment, it is vital that critical services have minimal downtime. It is important to understand how high availability (HA) is achieved in UCP and the DTR, and what to do to when it fails. UCP and DTR use the same principles to provide HA, but UCP is more directly tied to Swarm's features. The general principle is to have core services replicated in a cluster, which allows another node to take over when one fails. Load balancers make that transparent to the user by providing a stable hostname, independent of the actual node processing the request. It's the underlying clustering mechanism that provides HA.
 </p>
 <div class="mt-section" id="section_28" mt-section-origin="Architecture/Docker_Reference_Architecture:_Docker_EE_Best_Practices_and_Design_Considerations">
  <span id="Swarm">
  </span>
  <h3 id="2-12">
   Swarm
  </h3>
  <p>
   The foundation of UCP HA is provided by Swarm, the clustering functionality of Docker Engine. As detailed in the
   <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
    Docker Engine documentation
   </a>
   , there are two algorithms involved in managing a Swarm cluster: a Gossip protocol for worker nodes and the Raft consensus algorithm for managers. Gossip protocols are
   <em>
    eventually consistent
   </em>
   , which means that different parts of the cluster might have different versions of a value while new information spreads in the cluster (they are also called
   <em>
    epidemic protocols
   </em>
   because information spreads like a virus). This allows for very large scale cluster because it's not necessary to wait for the whole cluster to agree on a value, while still allowing fast propagation of information to reach consistency in an acceptable time. Managers handle tasks that need to be based on highly consistent information because they need to make decisions based on global cluster and services state.
  </p>
  <p>
   In practice,
   <em>
    high consistency
   </em>
   can be difficult to achieve without impeding availability because each write needs to be acknowledged by all participants, and a participant being unavailable or slow to respond will impact the whole cluster. This is explained by the
   <a class="link-https" href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
    CAP Theorem
   </a>
   , which (to simplify) states that in the presence of partitions (P) in a distributed system, we have to chose between consistency (C) or availability (A). Consensus algorithms like Raft address this trade-off using a
   <em>
    quorum
   </em>
   : if a majority of participant agree on a value, it is good enough, the minority participant eventually get the new value. That means that a write needs only acknowledgement from 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5, or 4 out of 7 nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of the way consensus works, an odd number of nodes is recommended when configuring Swarm. With 3 manager nodes in Swarm, the cluster can temporarily lose 1 and still have a functional cluster, with 5 you can lose 2, and so on. Conversely, you need 2 managers to acknowledge a write in a 3 manager cluster, but 3 with 5 managers, so more managers don't provide more performance or scalability — you are actually replicating more data. Having 4 managers doesn't add any benefits since you still can only lose 1 (majority is 3), and more data is replicated than with just 3. In practice, it is more fragile.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have 3 managers and lose 2, your cluster is non-functional. Existing services and containers keep running, but new requests are not processed.
   <strong>
    A single remaining manager in a cluster doesn't "switch" to single manager mode. It is just a minority node.
   </strong>
   You also cannot just promote worker nodes to manager to regain quorum. The failed nodes are still members of the consensus group and need to come back online.

   UCP

  <p>
   UCP runs a global service across all cluster nodes called
   <code>
    ucp-agent
   </code>
   . This agent installs a UCP controller on all Swarm manager nodes. There is a one-to-one correspondence between Swarm managers and UCP controllers, but they have different roles. Using its agent, UCP relies on Swarm for HA, but it also includes replicated data stores that rely on their own raft consensus groups that are distinct from Swarm: ucp-auth-store, a replicated database for identity management data, and ucp-kv, a replicated key-value store for UCP configuration data.

  <p>
   The DTR has a replication model that is similar to how UCP works, but it doesn't synchronize with Swarm. It has one replicated component, its datastore, which might also have a lot of state to replicate at one time. It relies on raft consensus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both UCP controllers and DTR replicas may have a lot more state to replicate when (re)joining the cluster. Some reconfiguration operations can make a cluster member temporary unavailable. With 3 members, it's good practice to wait for the one you reconfigured to get back in sync before reconfiguring a second one, or they could lose quorum. Temporary losses in quorum are easily recoverable, but it still means the cluster is in an unhealthy state. Monitoring the state of controllers to ensure the cluster doesn't stay in that state is critical.

   UCP Backup

  <p>
   UCP backup is done using the
   <code>
    docker/ucp backup

   command on a controller node. It stops the UCP containers on the node and perform a full backup of the configuration and state of UCP. Some of this information is sensitive, so you should always use the
   <code>
    --passphrase
   </code>
   option to encrypt the backup. The backup also includes the orgs, teams, and users used by DTR as well as UCP. Regular backups should be scheduled. Here is an example showing how to run the command without user input:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>UCPID=$(docker run --rm -i --name ucp -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker/ucp id)
docker run --rm -i --name ucp -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker/ucp backup --id $UCPID --passphrase "secret" &gt; /tmp/backup.tar
</code></pre>
  <p>
   There are two ways to use the backup: - To restore a controller using the
   <code>
    docker/ucp restore
   </code>
   command (only the backup from that controller can be used) - To install a new cluster using the

 <p>
  Accessing resources (images, containers, volumes, networks etc) and functionality within the components of Docker EE (UCP &amp; DTR) require at a minimum, an account and a corresponding password to be accessed. Accounts within Docker EE are identities stored within an internal database, but the source of creating those accounts and the associated access control can be manual (managed or internal) or external through a connection to a directory server (LDAP) or Active Directory (AD). Managing the authorization for these accounts is an extension of coarse and fine grained permissions that are described in the sections below.

   LDAP / AD Integration
  </h3>
  <p>
   The LDAP method of user account authentication can be turned on to manage user access. As the name suggests, this mode enables automatically synchronization of user accounts from a directory server such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP.
  </p>
  <p>
   This method is particularly applicable for enterprise use cases where organizations have a large set of users, typically maintained in a centralized identity store that manages both authentication and authorization. Most of these stores are based on a directory server such as Microsoft's Active Directory or a system that supports the LDAP protocol. Additionally, such enterprises already have mature processes for on-boarding, off-boarding, and managing the lifecycle of changes to user and system accounts. All these can be leveraged to provide a seamless and efficient process of access control within Docker EE.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pros:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Ability to leverage already established access control processes to grant and revoke permissions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ability to continue managing users and permissions from a centralized system based on LDAP.
   </li>
   <li>
    Increased security due to self-cleaning nature of this mode, where non-existent LDAP users are automatically removed from Docker EE on the next sync.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ability to configure complex upstream systems such as flat files, database tables using an LDAP proxy, and the automatic time-based de-provisioning of access through AD/LDAP groups.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Cons:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Increased complexity compared to Managed mode
   </li>
   <li>
    Higher admin requirements since knowledge on an external system (LDAP) is needed
   </li>
   <li>
    Greater time needed to troubleshoot issues with an extra components (LDAP) in the mix
   </li>
   <li>
    Unexpected changes to Docker EE due to changes made to upstream LDAP/AD systems, which can have unexpected effects on Docker EE
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   A recommended best practice is to use group membership to control access of users accounts to resources. Ideally, the management of such group membership is achieved through a centralized Identity Management or a Role Based Access Control system. This provides a standard, flexible, and scalable model to control the authentication and authorization rules within Docker EE through a centralized directory server. Through the Identity Management system, this directory server is kept in sync with user on-boarding, off-boarding, and changes in roles and responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   To change the mode of authentication, use the form at
   <strong>
    Admin Settings —&gt; Auth
   </strong>
   in the UCP UI. In this form, change the
   <strong>
    METHOD
   </strong>
   field under
   <strong>
    Authentication
   </strong>
   from the default value of
   <strong>
    Managed
   </strong>
   to
   <strong>
    LDAP
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Accounts that are discovered and subsequently synced from the directory server can be automatically assigned default permissions. It is recommended to leave the option for default permission to
   <strong>
    No Access
   </strong>
   Any necessary additional access can be granted based on group memberships.

    Integrate with LDAP documentation
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   This section highlights important configuration options to consider when setting up LDAP authentication.
  </p>
  <p>
   In LDAP auth mode, when accounts are discovered and subsequently imported, all previously created accounts in a Managed mode including the admin accounts are deleted. A new admin account is created when authentication is switched to LDAP. This admin account is a local account and is intended to be useable independent of the LDAP settings (for example, in a situation when there is a loss of connectivity to the directory server). The details of this admin account can be set during the sync using
   <strong>
    RECOVERY ADMIN USERNAME
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    RECOVERY ADMIN PASSWORD
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A user account on the directory server has to be configured to discover and import accounts from the directory server. This user account need not be a very powerful account. In fact, it is recommended that it is a read-only account that can view the necessary organizationalUnits (
   <code>
    ou
   </code>
   ) and query for group memberships. The details for this account are configured using the fields
   <strong>
    READER DN
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    READER PASSWORD
   </strong>
   . The
   <strong>
    READER DN
   </strong>
   must be in the distinguishedName format.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use secure LDAP if at all possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use the Test LDAP Connection section to make sure you can connect before switching to LDAP authentication.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the form is filled out and the test connection succeeds, the sync button provides an option to run a sync immediately without waiting for the next interval. Doing so initiates an LDAP connection and runs the filters to import the users. Any previously logged in user is logged out due to the disablement of all pre-existing accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="LDAP mode - Deactivate all existing accounts" class="internal" src="/kb/images/1911-3.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   After the sync is complete, it should be possible to log in using the recovery account and password. Be sure to test this recovery account. It should also be possible to log in using a sync-ed LDAP/AD account (the only supported attributes are
   <code>
    uid
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    sAMAccountName
   </code>
   ) and its corresponding LDAP/AD password. The sync-ed account should be in good standing within the LDAP/AD system for the login to be successful within Docker EE.
  </p>
  <p>
   The progress / status of the sync and any errors that occur can be viewed and analyzed on the controllers by running:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>docker logs ucp-controller
</code></pre>

  <h3 id="2-19">
   Teams
  </h3>
  <p>
   User accounts that exist within Docker EE, either through an LDAP sync or manually managed, can be organized into teams. Each team created can be assigned customized permissions and managed as a group of users as opposed to granting permissions to each user account on an individual basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teams can be created in the UCP UI using the
   <strong>
    TEAMS +Create
   </strong>
   interface under
   <strong>
    User Management
   </strong>
   . The same can be accomplished by using the eNZi API that is described in a later section. Members can be added to the team one-by-one. An alternative method of adding members to a team can be employed if using the LDAP Auth mode. This is based on an automatic sync of discovered accounts from the directory server that was configured to enable the LDAP Auth mode. Finer filters can be applied here which determine which discovered accounts are placed into which teams. A team can have multiple users, and a user can be a member of zero to multiple teams.

   RBAC and Managing Team Level Access to Resources
  </h3>
  <p>
   Permissions to resources through UCP are managed through default access levels. The default access permissions are
   <code>
    No Access
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    View Only
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    Restricted Control
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    Full Control
   </code>
   . Description about these permissions and how they relate to each other are detailed in the Reference Architecture
   <a href="https://success.docker.com/Architecture/Docker_Reference_Architecture%3A_Securing_Docker_EE_and_Security_Best_Practices" rel="internal">
    Securing Docker EE and Security Best Practices
   </a>
   . These permissions can be further extended by adding the user accounts to specific teams. In other words, the default permissions assigned directly to a user provide a coarse-grained access control. The user should then be added to teams to attain higher granularity in what a user account can do on specific containers, images, and other resources. The teams are assigned attributes in the form of labels that provide additional flexibility through a fine-grained access control. In some ways this mimics a traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC), where the teams are the roles assigned to user accounts, but there are specks of the finer Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) through the assignment of one of more labels to each team, which ultimately define the level of access of the account to UCP resources.
  </p>
  <p>
   While teams can be associated with as many labels as necessary, the resources within UCP like
   <code>
    services
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    images
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    volumes
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    networks
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    secrets
   </code>
   can also be associated with any one of these labels to tie the two together. It should be noted that any labels assigned to a service are automatically inherited by the tasks which currently are container workloads. So this behaves in just the same way as assigning meta information in the form of labels to containers (or any other resource for that matter). Internally, the resources are assigned a label with the key
   <code>
    com.docker.ucp.access.label
   </code>
   with the value as specified.
  </p>
  <p>
   It would be easier to understand with a concrete example as described in the following section.

  <h3 id="2-21">
   Strategy for Using LDAP Filters
  </h3>
  <p>
   This section demonstrates a typical use case that uses the principles of "least privilege / permission" as well as "separation of duties."
  </p>
  <p>
   Suppose you have a simple application called
   <code>
    www
   </code>
   , which is a web server based on the
   <code>
    nginx
   </code>
   official image. Say there are three teams that need access to this application —
   <code>
    developers
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    testers
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    operations
   </code>
   . Typically,
   <code>
    testers
   </code>
   need
   <code>
    View Only
   </code>
   access and nothing further, while the
   <code>
    operations
   </code>
   team usually needs
   <code>
    Full Control
   </code>
   . The
   <code>
    developers
   </code>
   team needs access to troubleshoot, restart, and control the lifecycle of the application but should be forbidden from any other activity involving the need to access the host file systems, or starting up privileged containers. This type of special access is termed
   <code>
    Restricted Control
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The users needing to access UCP are all sourced from the corporate Directory Server system. These users are the admin users needed to manage the Docker EE infrastructure as well as all members of each of the teams configured within UCP. Also assume that the total universe of users needing access to Docker EE (includes admins, developers, testers and operations) is a subset of the gamut of users within the Directory Server.
  </p>
  <p>
   A recommended strategy to use when organizing users is to create an overarching membership group that identifies all users of Docker EE irrespective of which team they are a part of. Let us call this group
   <code>
    Docker_Users
   </code>
   . No user should be made a member of this group directly. Instead, the
   <code>
    Docker_Users
   </code>
   group should have other groups in it and only groups as its members. Per our example, let us call these groups
   <code>
    dev
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    ops
   </code>
   . In our example, these groups are part of what is known as a
   <em>
    nested group
   </em>
   structure within the directory server. Nested groups allow the inheritance of permissions from one group to each of its sub-groups.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <strong>
     NOTE:
    </strong>
    Some directory servers do not support the feature of nested groups or even the `memberOf` attribute by default. If so, then they would need to be enabled. If the choice of directory server does not support these features at all, then alternate means of organizing users and querying them should be used. Microsoft Active Directory supports both these features out of the box.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   User accounts should be added as members of these sub-groups in the directory server. This should not impact any existing layout in the organization units or pre-existing group membership for these users.
  </p>
  <p>
   Within UCP, the first step is to enable the LDAP Auth mode. Under
   <strong>
    User Search Configurations
   </strong>
   , for the
   <strong>
    FILTER
   </strong>
   field, the value based on our example above should be
   <code>
    (&amp;(objectClass=person)(memberOf=cn=Docker_Users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Performing a sync with this setting discovers and import all users that are members of the group
   <code>
    Docker_Users
   </code>
   (through the nested sub-groups).
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, using the
   <strong>
    TEAMS +Create
   </strong>
   link under
   <strong>
    User Management
   </strong>
   , the individual teams can be created. An example of creating the
   <code>
    developers
   </code>
   team is shown below. The value of the
   <strong>
    Group DN
   </strong>
   field reflects the sub-group created under
   <code>
    Docker_Users
   </code>
   called
   <code>
    dev
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <img alt="Developers team creation" class="internal" src="/kb/images/1911-4.png"/>
  <p>
   After the team is created, bring up the
   <strong>
    Add Label
   </strong>
   form by clicking on the
   <strong>
    PERMISSIONS
   </strong>
   link. Here, as many permissions as needed can be added. In the image below, two labels are added to denote that members of the
   <code>
    developers
   </code>
   team have
   <code>
    View Only
   </code>
   access to any resource labeled as
   <code>
    production
   </code>
   . An additional label grants the members of the
   <code>
    developers
   </code>
   team
   <code>
    Full Control
   </code>
   on resources labeled as
   <code>
    development
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <img alt="Developers permissions" class="internal" src="/kb/images/1911-5.png"/>
  <p>
   Similarly, the
   <code>
    testers
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    operations
   </code>
   teams are created and assigned permissions per the table below:
  </p>
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>
      Team
     </th>
     <th>
      Group
     </th>
     <th>
      Permissions
     </th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <code>
       testers
      </code>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       cn=test,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
      </code>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       production
      </code>
      :
      <code>
       No Access
      </code>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       development
      </code>
      :
      <code>
       View Only
      </code>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <code>
       operations
      </code>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       cn=ops,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
      </code>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       production
      </code>
      :
      <code>
       Full Control
      </code>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
      <code>
       development
      </code>
      :
      <code>
       Full Control
      </code>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      ---
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      Now, you can now create the service
      <code>
       www
      </code>
      and assign it the appropriate
      <code>
       access label
      </code>
      to allow only specific users access to the resource using a command like below:
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <pre>
<code>docker service create --name www -p 80:80 --label com.docker.ucp.access.label=development nginx
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The same can be done in the UCP UI while creating a service by selecting an appropriate label (
   <code>
    development
   </code>
   in this example) from the
   <strong>
    PERMISSIONS LABEL
   </strong>
   dropdown as shown below. The label is applied to the service for enforcing role-based access control.
  </p>
  <img alt="Service create - Permissions Labels" class="internal" src="/kb/images/1911-6.png"/>
  <p>
   Only those labels that the logged in user has access to shows up in the dropdown. An admin user or a user assigned
   <code>
    Full Control
   </code>
   permission is shown all available labels regardless of the labels assigned to the team of which the user is a member of.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, create another service
   <code>
    www-prod
   </code>
   similarly based on the
   <code>
    nginx
   </code>
   image but with the
   <strong>
    Permission Label
   </strong>
   of
   <code>
    production
   </code>
   applied to it while logged in as a user
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   who is a member of the developers team. His permissions look as follows:
  </p>
  <img alt="Developers - boyle profile" class="internal" src="/kb/images/1911-7.png"/>
  <p>
   The account
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   can see both services,
   <code>
    www
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    www-prod
   </code>
   , but only the
   <code>
    www
   </code>
   service allows edits and other control because the permission label of
   <code>
    development
   </code>
   matches with the team's resource label of
   <code>
    development
   </code>
   granted with
   <code>
    Full Control
   </code>
   permissions. The
   <code>
    www-prod
   </code>
   service forbids any edits using the account
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   because it has a permission label of
   <code>
    production
   </code>
   , which has been marked as
   <code>
    View Only
   </code>
   in the team
   <code>
    developers'
   </code>
   resource label. For example, if the account
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   was used to scale up the number of replicas of each service, from 1 to 2 (for instance), an error of
   <code>
    Access Denied
   </code>
   would be thrown for the
   <code>
    www-prod
   </code>
   service, while the same would work for
   <code>
    www
   </code>
   service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, as evident in the profile image,
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   has
   <code>
    Default Permissions
   </code>
   of
   <code>
    No Access
   </code>
   . This prevents the
   <code>
    boyle
   </code>
   account from accessing any other resource unless the permission label and team resource label match and provide explicit permissions that override the
   <code>
    No Access
   </code>
   default permission.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, if and when it becomes necessary to terminate all access for any user account, removing the group membership of the account from just the one group
   <code>
    Docker_Users
   </code>
   would remove all access for the user. Due to the nature of how nested groups work, all additional access within Docker is automatically cleaned — the user account is removed from any and all team memberships at the time of the next sync without need for manual intervention or additional steps. This step can be integrated into a standard on-boarding / off-boarding automated provisioning step within a corporate Identity Management system.

  <span id="Authentication_API_(eNZi)">

  <h3 id="2-22">
   Authentication API (eNZi)
  </h3>
  <p>
   The AuthN API or eNZi (as it is known internally and pronounced N-Z) is a centralized authentication and authorization service and framework for Docker EE. This API is completely integrated and configured into Docker EE and works seamlessly with UCP as well as DTR. This is the component and service under the hood that manages accounts, teams and organizations, user sessions, permissions and access control through labels, Single-Sign-On (Web SSO) through OpenID Connect, and synchronization of account details from an external LDAP-based system into Docker EE.
  </p>
  <p>
   For regular day-to-day activities, users and operators need not be concerned with the AuthN API and how it works, however its features can be leveraged to automate many common functions and/or bypass the UCP UI altogether to manage and manipulate the data directly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The RESTFul AuthN API endpoints are documented in the
   <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/apidocs/v2.0.1/#!/accounts/func1" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
    AuthN API
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Interaction with AuthN can be accomplished in two ways: via the exposed RESTful AuthN API over HTTP or via the
   <code>
    enzi
   </code>
   command.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, the command below uses
   <code>
    curl
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    jq
   </code>
   to fetch all user accounts in Docker EE via the AuthN API over HTTP:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>curl --silent --insecure --header "Authorization: Bearer $(curl --silent --insecure \
     --data '{"username":"&lt;admin-username&gt;","password":"&lt;admin-password&gt;"}' \
    https://&lt;UCP-domain-name&gt;/auth/login | jq --raw-output .auth_token)" \
    https://&lt;UCP-domain-name&gt;/enzi/v0/accounts | jq .
</code></pre>
  <p>
   The AuthN service can also be invoked on the CLI on a UCP controller. To connect into it, run the following on a UCP controller:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>docker exec -it ucp-auth-api sh
</code></pre>
  <p>
   At the resulting prompt (
   <code>
    #
   </code>
   ), type the
   <code>
    enzi
   </code>
   command with a sub-command such as the one below to list the database table status:
  </p>
  <pre>
<code>enzi db-status
</code></pre>
