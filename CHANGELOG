      and as part of this change the overall experience has been improved:
        - `docker.local` now works in VPN compatibility mode (#2603)
        - exposing ports on the Mac is available in both networking modes (#2621)
        - port forwarding of privileged ports now works in both networking modes (#2557)
        - traffic to external DNS servers is no longer dropped in VPN mode (#2625)
    - `osxfs` now uses `AF_VSOCK` for transport (#2531, #2584) giving ~1.8x
	speedup for large sequential read/write workloads but increasing
	latency by ~1.3x. `osxfs` performance engineering work continues.
