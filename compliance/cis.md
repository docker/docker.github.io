The Center for Information Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark is a reference document that can be used by system administrators, security and audit professionals and other IT roles in order to establish a secure configuration baseline for the Docker Engine.

The latest benchmark for Docker v1.13.0 can be found [here](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf). The open source [Docker Bench for Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) toolkit can also be used to validate a running instance of Docker against the CIS Docker Benchmark.
