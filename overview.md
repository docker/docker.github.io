NOTICE:
The current doc theme does not allow us to create a split menu: a menu whose label is both a link and a dropdown. Our theme redesign fixes this but it is in RFD, so earliest out is about March 2016. In the mean time

* the overview.md pages to show up in the menu.
* when a user clicks Overview, we will redirect go to https://docs.docker.com/ucp/
* Later, after the redesign goes live, we will re-redirect in the unlikely event someone was able to book mark https://docs.docker.com/ucp/overview
