Welcome to Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon.

> **Note**
>
> Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon is still under development. We encourage you to try these builds and report any issues in the [Docker Desktop for Mac GitHub](https://github.com/docker/for-mac) repository.

## Docker Desktop RC 1

2021-03-18

Click on the following link to download the latest preview build of Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon.

This is our first Release Candidate, and is feature complete. If you find that anything is not working correctly (excluding the Known issues documented below), please open an issue in the [Docker Desktop for Mac GitHub](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues) repository.

### Known issues

The following issues are known and are not expected to be resolved in the final GA build for Apple Silicon. We are working on them in collaboration with our partners.

- You must install Rosetta 2 as some binaries are still Darwin/AMD64. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, use this command:

    ```
    softwareupdate --install-rosetta
    ```
    We expect to fix this in a future release.

- Not all images are available for ARM64 architecture. You can add `--platform linux/amd64` to run an Intel image under emulation. In particular, the [mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated) image is not available for ARM64. You can work around this issue by using a [mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=last_updated) image.

   However, attempts to run Intel-based containers on Apple Silicon machines can crash as QEMU sometimes fails to run the container. Therefore, we recommend that you run ARM64 containers on Apple Silicon machines. These containers are also faster and use less memory than Intel-based containers.

   We expect this issue to become less common over time, as more and more images are rebuilt [supporting multiple architectures](https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/).

- Some VPN clients can prevent the VM running Docker from communicating with the host, preventing Docker Desktop starting correctly. See [docker/for-mac#5208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5208).

   We expect to fix this in a future release.

- Docker Desktop is incompatible with macOS Internet Sharing. See [docker/for-mac#5348](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5348).

   This is an interaction between `vmnet.framework` (as used by `virtualization.framework` in Big Sur) and macOS Internet Sharing. At the moment it is not possible to use Docker Desktop and macOS Internet Sharing at the same time. We are investigating possible workarounds and hope to make improvements in a future release.

- Some container disk I/O is much slower than expected. See [docker/for-mac#5389](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389). Disk flushes are particularly slow due to the need to guarantee data is written to stable storage on the host.

   This is an artifact of the new `virtualization.framework` in Big Sur. We are investigating possible fixes and hope to make improvements in a future release.

- TCP and UDP port 53 (DNS) are bound on the host when Docker Desktop starts. Therefore you cannot bind to port 53 on all interfaces with a command like `docker run -p 53:53`. See [docker/for-mac#5335](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5335).

   This is an artifact of the new `virtualization.framework` in Big Sur. A workaround is to bind to a specific IP address e.g. `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:53:53`.

- The Linux Kernel may occasionally crash. Docker now detects this problem and pops up an error dialog offering the user the ability to quickly restart Linux.

   We are still gathering data and testing alternate kernel versions and hope to make improvements in a future release.

### Fixes since Docker Desktop preview 3.1.0

- The build should update automatically to future versions.
- HTTP proxy support is working, including support for domain name based `no_proxy` rules via TLS SNI. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2732](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2732).
