# Files and directories here are not edited in the docker.github.io repo.
# Instead, they are edited in the appropriate upstream repo and pulled
# into this repo periodically. The intent is that if you submit a PR
# with changes to these files or directories, a CI job will fail in the
# PR, indicating that it should not be merged.

# If you need to edit these files or directories, submit a PR in one of the
# following repos. The file will probably be located within the docs/ subdirectory.
