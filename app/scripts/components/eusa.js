Order Form all Subscription Services granted herein or therein will
automatically terminate and Customer will discontinue all use of the
applicable Licensed Software and Supported Software and will return to

### 9. Confidentiality

9.1 **Definition.** "Confidential Information" means any information
disclosed by one party ("Discloser") to the other ("Recipient"),
directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible
objects, which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some
similar designation, or learned by Recipient under circumstances in
which such information would reasonably be understood to be
confidential. Confidential Information may include information disclosed
in confidence to Discloser by third parties. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the Licensed Software, and the results of any performance,
functional or other evaluation of the Licensed Software, shall be deemed
Confidential Information of Docker.

9.2 **Exceptions.** The confidentiality obligations in this Section 8
shall not apply with respect to any of the Discloser's Confidential
information which Recipient can demonstrate: (a) was in the public
domain at the time it was disclosed to Recipient or has become in the
public domain through no act or omission of Recipient; (b) was known to
Recipient, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by
the files of Recipient in existence at the time of disclosure; (c) was
disclosed by Recipient with the prior written approval of Discloser; (d)
was independently developed by Recipient without any use of Discloser's
Confidential Information by employees or other agents of (or contractors
hired by) Recipient who had no access to or did not rely on Discloser's
Confidential Information; or (e) became known to Recipient, without
restriction, from a source other than Discloser without breach of this
Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not in violation of Discloser's
rights.

9.3 **Restrictions on Use and Disclosure.** Recipient agrees not to use
Discloser's Confidential Information or disclose, distribute or
disseminate Discloser's Confidential Information except in furtherance
of the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights
hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by Discloser in writing.
Recipient agrees to restrict access to such Confidential Information to
those employees or consultants of Recipient who need to know such
Confidential Information for performing as contemplated hereunder and
have agreed in writing to be bound by a confidentiality obligation no
less protective than that contained in this Agreement. Recipient shall
exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or
disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information to others as it takes
to preserve and safeguard its own information of like importance, but in
no event less than reasonable care.

9.4 **Compelled Disclosure.** If Recipient is compelled by a court or
other competent authority or applicable law to disclose Confidential
Information of Discloser, it shall give Discloser prompt written notice
and shall provide Discloser with reasonable cooperation at Discloser's
expense so that Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or
obtain a restraining order. Recipient shall not be in breach of its
obligations in this Section 9 if it makes any legally compelled
disclosure provided that Recipient meets the foregoing notice and
cooperation requirements.

9.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Recipient acknowledges that breach of the
confidentiality obligations would cause irreparable harm to Discloser,
the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly,
Recipient agrees that Discloser is entitled to immediate injunctive
relief in the event of breach of an obligation of confidentiality by
Recipient, and that Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or
show irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.

9.6 **Return of Confidential Information.** As between the parties,
Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser. At
any time, upon Discloser’s reasonable request, Recipient shall promptly
(and in any event within 30 days) return to Discloser or destroy, at the
election of the Discloser, any Confidential Information of the
Discloser. In addition, within 30 days after termination of this
Agreement, Recipient shall (i) promptly return all tangible materials
containing such Confidential Information to Discloser, (ii) remove all
Confidential Information (and any copies thereof) from any computer
systems of the Recipient, its contractors and its distributors, and
confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential
Information have been destroyed or returned to Discloser, as applicable,
by Recipient. Recipient shall cause its affiliates, agents, contractors,
and employees to strictly comply with the foregoing.

SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." DOCKER, ITS
SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS
WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SUPPORTED
SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT,
TOGETHER WITH ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR
USAGE IN TRADE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN,
OBTAINED FROM DOCKER OR ELSEWHERE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT
EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF
THE FOREGOING, DOCKER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (A) CUSTOMER’S USE OF
THE SUPPORTED SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S
REQUIREMENTS, OR (B) CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SUPPORTED SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT
SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR.

### 11. Indemnification

11.1 **By Docker.** Docker shall defend at its own expense any legal
action brought against Customer to the extent that it is based on a
claim or allegation that the Licensed Software infringes a U.S. patent
or copyright of a third party, and Docker will pay any costs and damages
awarded against Customer in any such action, or agreed to under a
settlement signed by Docker, that are attributable to any such claim but
shall not be responsible for any compromise made or expense incurred
without Docker’s consent. Such defense and payments are subject to the
conditions that (a) Customer gives Docker prompt written notice of such
claim, (b) tenders to Docker sole control of the defense and settlement
of the claim, and (c) reasonably cooperates with Docker when requested
in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim. Docker will
have no liability to so defend and pay for any infringement claim to the
extent it (i) is based on modification of the Licensed Software other
than by Docker, with or without authorization; (ii) results from failure
of Customer to use an updated version of the Licensed Software; or (iii)
is based on the combination or use of the Licensed Software with any
software (including, without limitation, Open Source Software), program
or device not provided by Docker if such infringement would not have
arisen but for such use or combination; or (iv) results from use of the
Licensed Software by Customer after the license was terminated.

11.2 **Limitation of IP Damages.** Should any Licensed Software, or the
operation thereof, become or in Docker's opinion be likely to become,
the subject of such claim described in Section 11.1, Docker may, at
Docker's option and expense, procure for Customer the right to continue
using the Licensed Software, replace or modify the Licensed Software so
that it becomes non-infringing, or terminate the license granted
hereunder for such Licensed Software. THIS SECTION 11 STATES DOCKER'S
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY,
WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

11.3 **By Customer.** Customer agrees to hold harmless and indemnify
Docker and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees,
advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any third
party claim arising from or in any way related to Customer’s breach of
this Agreement, use of the Supported Software, or violation of
applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Supported
Software, including any liability or expense arising from all claims,
losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation
costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case,
Docker will provide Customer with written notice of such claim, suit or
action.

### 12. Limitation of Liability.

12.1 **Exclusion of Damages.** CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES
THAT DOCKER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL
NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCURRED BY CUSTOMER, HOWEVER CAUSED
AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF
GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED, COST OF
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON DOCKER'S LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR
NOT DOCKER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT DOCKER'S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES
WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

12.2 **Liability Cap.** EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO EITHER PARTY’S
OBLIGATIONS OF INDEMNIFICATION, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DOCKER ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF USD
\$100 OR THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE RELEVANT SUPPORTED
SOFTWARE UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM, IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH
PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

### 13. Export Restrictions.

Customer understands that the Supported Software may contain encryption
technology and other software programs that may require an export
license from the U.S. State Department and that export or re-export of
the Supported Software to certain entities (such as a foreign government
and its subdivisions) and certain countries is prohibited. Customer
acknowledges that it will comply with all applicable export and import
control laws and regulations of the United States and the foreign
jurisdiction in which the Supported Software is used and, in particular,
Customer will not export or re-export the Supported Software without all
required United States and foreign government licenses. Customer will
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Docker and its suppliers and
licensors from and against any violation of such laws or regulations by
Customer or any of its agents, officers, directors or employees.

### 14. Miscellaneous

The Supported Software and any other software covered under this
Agreement are "commercial items" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
2.101; consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire the Supported
Software and any other software and documentation covered under this
Agreement with only those rights set forth herein. This Agreement will
be governed by the laws of the State of California without reference to
conflict of law principles. Each party agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco,
California to resolve any legal matter arising from this Agreement.
Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Docker may assign the entirety of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, without consent of the
Customer, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its
assets. The application of the UN Convention of International Sale of
Goods to this Agreement is disclaimed in its entirety. Together with any
Order Forms, this is the entire agreement between the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement (including applicable Order
Forms) shall control over any additional or different terms of any
correspondence, order, confirmation, invoice or similar document, even
if accepted in writing by both parties, and waivers and amendments of
any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if made by
non-preprinted agreements indicating specifically what sections of this
Agreement are affected, signed by both parties and clearly understood by
both parties to be an amendment or waiver. The failure of either party
to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period
shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any provision of
this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the invalid or
unenforceable provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to
make it valid and enforceable. When a new Subscription Term begins the
most current version of this Agreement made available by Docker shall be
applicable to Customer's use of the Software.`
